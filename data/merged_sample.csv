"I agree with NASA that the face was not made my aliens, and that it is a natural monument. My reasons are because the shadows are what makes it a face. Another reason is because you can really ress it unless there are shadows and your rihg tover it. My last reason is that Mars Global Surveyor Cyldonia took pictures of the Face and proved that it is natural.

The shadows give is it's face because there is bumps on mars, so that when shadows go a certain direction, it casts shadows and makes it look like a human face on Mars. In the article it says "" A few days late NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...whihc resembles a human head.. formed by shadows giving the illision of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The author reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and atrract attention to Mars."" This goes on to prove my next point.

Marc Global Surveyor Cyldonia has taken better picture of what they so call ""the Face"" on Mars.

It says

"" And so on April 5,1998, when Marz Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera(MOC) team snapped a picture tem time sharper than the original Viking photos. THousands of anxious web surfer were waiting when the image appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This goes to show that it was not formed by aliens and it was not created there on purpose.

My last reason is that you can really see it unless there is a shadow or you look at it at a exact angle. The article proved this by saying this "" Neerthe less, on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enought for a second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degees to center the Face in the feild view,"" said Garvin. ""Malin's team caputred an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resoltion."" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meter, compared to 43 meter per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This is proving that with a better camera and a better view that it was naturally made and you have to look at it from certain angles to see the face.

Yes, I agree with NASA that ""the Face"" is nothing but a natural landform, and not something created by life on a different planet. My reasons being the shadows are the only thing that gives it it's face, Mars Global Surveyor took better pictures of the landform, and you can't really see it unless you look from a certain agngle or direction. The momument is VERY natual in my eyes.",1,02e446443d5147cb98b65a8659059489
"School uniforms have been a controversial topic in public schools for years. Many believe that school uniforms are beneficial and provide many positive aspects to the students, while others feel they stifle creativity and individual expression. This essay will discuss both sides of the debate, weighing out the pros and cons of incorporating mandatory school uniform policies within public institutions. One argument against implementing school uniforms is that it takes away from student’s individuality. By limiting what they can wear, students may feel restricted in their ability to express themselves through clothing choices. It could also lead to bullying as those without style or who cannot keep up with current trends become easily identifiable targets among peers in a group setting where everyone looks exactly alike. Furthermore, requiring all children to dress similarly could teach them conformity rather than encouraging creative thinking outside of the norm - something which should be encouraged within educational settings at an early age. On the other hand, proponents claim that introducing compulsory uniform policies reduces distractions and increases safety on campus grounds by eliminating differences between social statuses based on clothes worn each day; especially since most wealthy families are likely able to afford more fashionable items than those from lower income backgrounds would be able purchase for their kids due to financial restraints . Uniforms also make getting ready for school easier as parents no longer need worry about buying “trendy” clothes their child might not like after only wearing them once or twice before outgrowing them anyway; this ultimately saves money over time versus shopping constantly for new clothing amidst ever-changing fashion trends throughout childhood development stages. Additionally, when students look similar it helps create an atmosphere focused solely on learning instead of competing with peers over appearances or certain materials goods amongst one another during class hours which can help improve overall performance levels within educational institutions as well . . In conclusion , although requiring all students within public schools adhere to set guidelines concerning wardrobe attire has both its benefits and drawbacks . Ultimately , we must decide if any potential outcomes outweigh each other enough so we may

"We often take for granted the beauty of a sunrise until we see it for ourselves. The majesty of a sunrise is one that is rarely experienced and even more rarely appreciated as much as it should be. The sun peaks over the horizon, illuminating a sky painted with an array of vibrant colors ranging from pinks, to purples and oranges all blended together in perfect harmony. As its light spreads across the day’s new beginnings, you can almost feel yourself relax – any worries or troubles drifting away along with yesterday’s sunset. Birds begin to chirp their morning songs and nature starts to come alive around us. It's like this fresh start has lifted everyone out of their slumber and awakened them into what will be another beautiful day in life!. There are few experiences more peaceful than watching a sunrise unfold before your eyes; whether alone or surrounded by family & friends share in this momentous occasion which reminds us that every day brings something new and exciting on the horizon if we only open our minds to appreciate it fully. Witnessing such natural beauty gives us hope that no matter how difficult things may seem at times, each tomorrow holds its own unique opportunities waiting for us whereby we can strive towards making those dreams become realities. . It's easy to get overwhelmed by life sometimes but experiencing something so breathtakingly special helps put everything back into perspective again - there really aren't many better ways to remind yourself that “This too shall pass” because today will be gone soon enough giving way for yet another brilliant beginning when once again we'll have front row seats at Nature’s showtime: The Sunrise!

"In recent years, the use of electric vehicles (EVs) has become increasingly popular as a way to reduce environmental pollution. EVs are an efficient and eco-friendly alternative to traditional gas-powered cars, and their popularity is growing due to their numerous advantages over gasoline-powered vehicles. This essay will examine the role of EV technology in reducing air pollution, its economic savings for drivers, and how it can help protect the environment. The most obvious benefit of electric vehicles is that they produce significantly less emissions than traditional gas-powered vehicles. According to estimates from the EPA’s 2020 Vehicle Emissions Modeling tool, driving a traditional car produces more than twice as much greenhouse gases per mile compared with an EV powered by clean electricity sources such as wind or solar energy. Electric cars produce no tailpipe pollution whatsoever; this means that switching to an EV can help reduce smog and other types of air pollutants which contribute heavily to climate change and public health problems like asthma. Moreover, since EVs have no oil or lubricants that need changing there are fewer toxic materials being released into our environment overall – something not possible with gas engines!. . Additionally, those who switch from a petrol vehicle to an electric one may be able to save money in fuel costs over time due to reduced maintenance needs compared with internal combustion engines (ICE). An EV motor requires almost no maintenance throughout its lifetime when compared against ICE motors which require regular tune ups and oil changes every few thousand miles - leading up front cost savings despite higher purchase prices on some models! In addition, many governments offer tax credits for buying new or used EVs so you could potentially make back some expenses incurring while purchasing your vehicle too! Finally, depending on energy rates where you live charging an EV at home overnight may also cost significantly less than refuelling a conventional car at your local petrol station each week – so those looking for long term cost savings should definitely consider going electric!. Finally it's important we recognize

"I belive that the Facial Action Coding system reading is very accurate and can be used in the classoom might help. Theres many ways that if the teacher is aware she/he can might can help out that student. Theres a saying that states ""you cannot read a persons mind"" which is true but you can sense there emotions by the look on their face sometimes . The Facial Action Coding can help you read fully what this person is feeling.

For examples The Facail Coding System can tell if you're faking your smile to keep from showing how you really feel teachers wouldnt know how you feel unless you tell them whats going on with you. Using the coding system can tell the teacher your emtions that way they can deal with it and move forward in your learning. Not only just a happy and sad emotion the system can consist but when the teacher is teaching the lesson she can tell if the students get in by the expression on their face the sensor can tell weather or not the student is fustrated or confused on what the he/she is teaching. The teacher can get a percentage of the students emotions about the lesson if teacher gets the results and they show simlar patterns of confusion among the she can revist the lesson . In paragraph 6 it states when the compture predicts how the student is feeling it can ""modify the lesson "" I believe that it'll help the student learn the lesson like everybody else is in their own way because everybody has different levels of learning

In conclusion I believe that ther Facail dectection can be very helpful in the classroom setting. It can help teachers learn and create lesson for everybody to get a better understanding in what they are teaching.

"Do you think it is more beneficial to work in groups? Do you think working in groups makes you focus? Do you think working in groups is easy and fun?.

Do you think working in groups is more easier?. May people will say No and others will say yes to all these four question. working in groups is more beneficial than working alone. I think working in groups is more beneficial and good for many reasons because; we collaborate and share ideas, it more fun and easy working together and get a chance to work with people we really dont talk to. and we also get our project or work done on time.

Working in groups helps us by sharing ideas: i think working in groups is very important. it helps us bring our minds together to brainstorm some ideas or by sharing opinoin about the project or the assignment we are working on. we can discuss and make sure we understand and know the topic that we are working on. by doing this is a great thing because every person is contributing or participating in what we are working on.

Secondly, We get everything organized and get our things done on time: working alone somethings is very terrible because i takes a while to finsh, you dont get it done on time and sometimes you might need help from somebody, which sucks but working in groups more quicker. since there is about atleast three or four people in the group. it makes it more faster to get it done on time. it makes it even more easier to get the assignment done by contributing and aslo,

assigning or giving each and every person in the group a role to play or something to do to support the group in order to get it done on time.

Lastly, another reason why working in groups is beneficial is because it is easy and fun working together and let us get a chance to work with some people you really dont talk to in school. Most people likes dont like to socialize with people they dont know so they choose to work alone. which is okay,

but i think working as groups fun and easy. plus ,

it is very beneficial. I feel like working in groups is more fun. it makes us feel more free and more open to work together. when working with a group of people it is more fun because someone in the group may crack a joke or say something funny, it might cause a little bit of distraction but it brings laughter, smile, joy and happiness into our faces and that is what makes more fun and exciting to work together as a group.

In conlcusion, it is more beneficial working in groups than working alone. In groups we share ideas, we finish on time before due date and it is more fun and easy to work together with people but not just by yourself. because in groups we disscuss and make sure everyone in the group understand before we start putting effort in what we are about to do. it is very important to work together in groups because it tells us that we should encourage ourselves and work together as a team. And by showing a team work, hardwork , support and determination makes a group work more successful.            ",1,afc5a4cda3f54327a7e305cc268a4105
"Dear state senator, Ever since 1776, The United States of America has been a great example of freedom, excellence, and democracy. After all, the U.S. is one of the biggest supporters of democracy, and is all about the rights of their people. So imagine my shock to learn that this country, in fact, does not rely on it's people to vote for their leader. Which, to many people would be the simplest form of freedom out there. Instead, we have the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a number of electors that represent a state. ""Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...."" What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register In this quote, it explains that the Electoral College is based on the existing population in your state therefore, the more people you have, the more electors the state receives. However, this sounds great and all, but in my opinion, a direct democracy would work great for this country because it would generate just representation of the people by allowing them to make the vote, encourage voters and remind them that they have a voice, and immediately destroy the chances of a representative to vote for an opposing candidate.

America is all about their people. And of course, the government wants to do what's best for them, right? Voting is a right that American citizens achieve when they reach the matured age of eighteen. It's supposed to feel like a blessing that we get to decide and have a voice in the process of election. But, with the Electoral College, it ""...may turn off potential voters of a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state."" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner So the citizens of this country are beginning to feel like their say in this decision will have little to no impact. This will affect the amount of voters and will ultimately cause a huge problem in the way people feel about representation.

Enough about the people, how about the electors? ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer This means that not even when the people vote for all their electors and they should be selecting the correct candidate, they may change their minds. Electors are people too, and people may have their opinions swayed and then the electors could vote for the other candidate. It is scary to think that the candidate everyone chose and was rooting for might not win because someone decided to make a different decision.

And some people might stand up for the Electoral College, say that ""The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates...to focus their campain efforts on the tossup states."" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner It later goes on to say that because of this, the citizens in the Swing States become the most thoughtful voters because they receive the most information on the candidates. However, wouldn't we, as a country, prefer all of our potential voters to be informed and wellaware of our candidates? ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states...focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer Why should the fate of the presidency be laid in the hands of such a small amount of people when our country is meant to be for everybody in the land?

As a concluding statement, senator, I want you to consider my argument that we'd be better off without the Electoral College because citizens should be able to decide who they want to run, they should feel important, they should all be wellinformed, and electors that change their minds wouldn't even be a problem anymore. Thank you for taking the time to consider my letter.",1,6199e39bd9f24371b5e5e40dbb14c3de
"Personally, I believe that there are many advantages to limiting usage of a motor vehicle. There would be less air pollution, quicker public transportation, and more social contact.

Firstly, as stated in almost every article the main goal of stopping people from driving their cars was that their was too much air pollution going on throughout these cities. There was a nearrecord days of pollution which made some cities in Europe decide the make partial laws to restrict people from using their cars all the time. Personally I think that is a great idea to stop people from driving cars. People not driving cars all the time benefits everyone because the air pollution would eventually be hazardous to everyone leading to casualties and deaths.

Secondly, public transportation would be so much easier to get around with since there is barely traffic around. Could you imagine how easy it would be to get around using the bus or a taxi since there would be no traffic jams or accidents on the road. Of course since basically no one would have the accessibility to cars there would be much more public transportation but i doubt it would amount up to how many single cars you see on the road.

Also, one article stated that, Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" meaning that all this occurred due to the dramatic change in everyone driving their cars. I believe that this happened as a social thing because of everyone is always alone in their motor vehicle driving past everyone without a word said, rather than walking past a person with a smile on your face and making face to face contact. Usually the parks and sports centers are getting all these people in there because everyone walking or biking would pass by a park and say that they would want to hang out there for a minute since they hadn't been before or just walk in it to check it out since its on the way.

In Conclusion this is what i think of the advantages of limiting car usage. I think its good for the environment, makes public transportation quicker, and makes people more social.",1,1137872fb63c4dada089fc2cbb442e38
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author writes about a great number problems that come along with trying to get information on the our planetary neighbor, Venus. We, the readers, learn in detail about the specific challenges that come along with studying Venus, even with its close proximity to us. Despite the author describing all of the struggles that come along with studying our sister planet, the passage still supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthwile pursuit, through giving us strong examples of useful information we could learn, and describing safer and easier ways that we could study it that would make it far more simple to get the desired data.

While there are certainly many difficulties that the passage describes about getting information from Venus, the author thoroughly explains all of the great scientific benefits that we could get out of a Venus mission. As the author describes in paragraph four, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Not only will information about Venus teach us more about the universe around us, it might just be useful in order to study our own planet. Being able to learn so much from what a previous Earth could have been like would be a massive benefit to fields like history, and the earth sciences. The author goes into even more detail about this just afterward, describing how ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Not only are they similar from a geological perspective, it could provide vital information to the studies of biology, and possibly even support details about where we came from to begin with. There are hundreds, if not thousands of scientists specifically studying the cosmos trying to find planets with water that even have a small chance of supporting any form of life. The potential for further discovery here only a short distance away is extrodinary, and the author wisely emphasizes this through the passage.

Not only is the possibility for fascinating exploration and gaining crucial information about the Earth from Venus supported, the author also makes the important point that we are coming closer and closer by the day to this becoming a reality. In the seventh paragraph the author discusses this idea. ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" When they put some of the brightest engineers in the world to a specific task of making electronics that could survive in Venus, the results were successful, as they made them able to survive for almost a month. While a month doesn't sound like a long time for the equipment to last, the author mentions later on in the passage that ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme phyisical conditions."" The most delicate part any device that would land on Venus would be the electronics inside any rover or measuring equipment. The great advances in the durability of these electronics points toward an optimistic future in devices designed for Venus, as we are already seeing incredible progess being made. However, what would happen if they couldn't find a way around the delicacy of modern computers? The author proves that wouldn't be the end of our Venus hopes, that mechanical computers can be utilized in order to avoid easily broken hardware. Even in the worst case scenerio, our scientists are still devising ways to land a probe on Venus.

Though the author presents some great challenges in getting samples and other data from Venus, he strongly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit through the development of new and better ways to survive the harsh atmosphere, and information that could be gained from it that is useful to studying scientific and historical fields back here on Earth that he mentions in the passage. The human race, throughout history, has always remained curious and are willing to sacrifice and go through long periods of experimentation to acheieve knowledge. We have faced these struggles as humans before, and this will not be the struggle that stops us.",1,6ea121bd530345a59ff929db3b4ad06b
"It's illegal to drive with a phone and its multiple why you can't drive without a phone. A cell phone is a one second distraction taking your eyes off the road increases the risk of crashing.

"One topic that people debate a lot is that students expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. they courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. I think is not a good idea for a student to commit to a career at a young age. because students are not old enough they careless and not make the best decision when they at a young age.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because, students are not old enough to know what they career in specific. they not prepared for the world students in high school don't have any experience of any career.

I think is a little to early. I will explore all type of career when my senior junior year starts I would make sure to select the right courses and the better one to be prepared or have experience for your career.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because sometimes teenagers are careless something may go wrong with your life or you just wanna do something new. all those classes that I selected from freshman year are not gonna be worth it because you gonna have to take new classes. for example my friend selected a technology class in freshman year, and he search it up how much they make in a year and that was not what he expected. so he change to materials and process to learn how to cut, and built houses.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because, when you are in a young are you make the wrong decision well sometimes but I think the best decision for me during high school is to to wait and study the better classes and the best and better career. and to be able to do that you have to care about classes and be responsible with school and career.

As you read you can see the reasons,I think the best idea for students is to focus in high school and get good grades when you get to senior year or college, you know more about life and careers I think that would be the best time to selected the best classes that are gonna guide you toward a specific career.",1,861a72418247450abd59bbf4bcf4a555
"Why the Electoral College Should be Replaced

Dear Mr. Senator, ever since the Presidential Election of 2000, the concept of our electoral college has been highly scrutinized, and this is rightly so. The electoral college is undemocratic, unfair, and should be replaced with the popular vote.

Even people who support keeping the electoral college (such as the author of

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , Richard A. Posner) agree that ""...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense.."" (paragraph 15). America was founded on democracy and making sure that the people's voices were heard, and not allowing the people to directly vote for the leader of the country goes against that.

The electoral college is also extremely unfair to voters. Because of how the election system is set up, a candidate could win the people's popular vote, but not the electoral votes and would then not recieve presidency. This occured in 2000 in the Gore vs Busch election. Even though a majority of people voted for Gore, Busch still ended up with the presidency (paragraph 9). Having the electoral votes take pecedence over the popular vote takes away the people's voice and bscially tells them that their opinion doesn't matter as much as the electoral college's opinion.

The electoral college is also unfair because it discourages campaigning in non-swing states. A democratic candidate would not campaign in a state like California that is heavily democratic because they know they are almost definitley going to win the election in that state, meaning they will get all of that state's electoral votes. A republican candidate would not campaign in Caliornia either because they know they would have almost no chance of winning in such a heavily democratic state, and they would be wasting campaign money with no hope of electoral votes from that state (paragraph 13). This means that people in non-swing states like California don't really know much about either candidate because they were never informed. Then the people in these states tend to vote for their party solely because they have nothing else to go off of. It is unfair for voters in non-swing states to be left in the dark just because all of the electoral votes are almost guaranteed to go one way. If the US used popular votes for the Presidential Election, republicans in democratic states and democrats in republican states would have a voice too.

Another way the electoral college is unfair, is the standing procedure in the event of a tie. There are 538 electors in the electoral college (paragraph 3) which is an even number, meaning the electoral votes for each candidate could be tied. In the event of a tie, the House of Representatives would have an election and each state would get one vote. That would mean ""...the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"" (paragraph 12). This would make someone from California's vote count for much less than someone from Wyomig's vote.

It can be argued that the electoral college is beneficial in the fact that the winning candidate's share of electoral votes exceeds his share of popular votes. For example, in the 2012 election, Obama recieved 61.7% of the electoral votes compared to 51.3% of popular votes (paragraph 18). Some say this is beneficial because it reduces the chance of a dispute of vote counting. However, this is actually not a good thing. 51.3% of people wanted Obama to be President. Not 61.7%. Yet Obama still got credit for 61.7%. About 10% of voters who didn't support Obama didn't get their opinion heard.

The electoral college has been around for a long time, and it's time for a change. It is simply undemocratic and unfair. It prevents every person for having an equally weighted vote. The electoral college needs to be replaced with a popular vote.

Thank you for your time Mr. Senator.

"Automobiles have proved to be very convenient to our modern day society. It allows people to travel 20 miles in ten to fifteen minutes. By foot, it would take about four hours to travel that distance. Although cars have been beneficial, the limitation of car usage would outweigh the benefits of constantly relying on them. Decreasing the amount of time we spend in them would improve public transportation, improve air quality, and create less stress.

Cutting down the amount of car usage would encourage the use of public transportation. According to Source 1, the essentially car-less suburban, Vanbaun, has made public transportation more accessible. Increasing the use of it would decrease the time it takes to commute from place to place. Less cars on the roads mean less traffic. In small towns, not as many people currently use the system on a regular basis. With the limiting of car usage, public transportation could become more popular in suburban areas, not just metropolitan cities. Some may not want to take this form of transportation because it may not meet their sanitary needs. However, if the popularity increases, cities will be obligated to improve the conditions. Public transportation could be the new primary form of transportation if we limit the amount of time cars are allowed to be used.

Additionally, a large problem in the world today is air pollution and globabl warming. Automobiles cause the majority of this ongoing problem. Less time spent in the car would eventually lead to better air quality. Source 2 states that in Paris, France the smog in the city was near-record pollution. This caused Paris to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air. Congestion was cut down 60% after this action was taken. Vehicles release numerous harmful greenhouse gases that we have been trying to reduce. These gases not only harm the environment, but the people as well. New and popular alternatives to the common diesel cars are hybrids and electric cars. Less car usage would result in reduction of pollution.

Also, using a car less decreases stress levels. According to Source 3, in Bogota, Colombia, citizens participate in the very popular car-free day. A businessman in Colombia said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress."" Cars do not allow people's mind to stop and rest. A driver's mind is constantly thinking and attempting to get to their destination as fast as possible. If cars were barely used, people could take a serene stroll to their destination, allowing the mind to slow down, think, and relax. Parks and recreation would expand and improve as well due to the smaller vicinity we can reach by foot or bike. New and improved public areas would become more enjoyable, making us less stressed. Stress levels decline as car usage declines.

The increased use of public transportation, improved air quality, and lower stress levels all result from the limitations of car usage. As beneficial as a car may be to people, limiting the use of it is more advantageous than not. Car companies are still widely developing as highways and roads are expanding, but our society should go the other direction and find healthier sources of transportation.",1,6b71485f52ef45a4be2d80dfecceeb2c
"We should keep our method of chosing a president even though many dont agree because of a few reasons. One, big states. Two, avoid run off elections. Finnaly, to determine the certainty of outcome.

First, the issue of big states. States are put in two categories, big states and small states, according to population. Presidential candidates give more of their attention during the campaign to the larger states. As a result of electoral college the big states have more electors and thus more votes. For example, in Forida, the popular vote was extremely close in 2012, Obama who won, got 29 electoral votes. If obama had spent that time in Wyoming, he would have only had gotten 3 electoral votes.

Second, to avoid run off elections. Using the electoral college we avoid the problem of elections where no candidate receives a majority. the electoral college can produce a clear winner rather than pressure when no candidate wins majority and complications of the process. Two examples of this in 1968 and 1992 with president nixon and president Clinton. They both had 43 percent plurality of popular vote, while winning a majority of electoral college.

Finnally, to determine Certainty of outcome. Since, almost all states have electoral votes on a winner takes all basis, even the slightest plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state. Although, it is possible to have a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college, for instance in 20000, it is much less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. And even though a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes is an even number of 538, it is extremely unlikely to happen.

You could argue that the method of selecting a president through Electoral college may turn off potential voters for a candidate that has no hope if carrying their state, knowing their vote will have no effect. Then they might have less incentive to pay attention to the campaigngn. But being realistic, no voters one vote swings a national election, and about one half of the eligible American population did vote in 2012's election.

In conclusion, the reasons we shoud kee our current method of chosng the countries president is becuause of big states, to avoid run off elections, and to determine he certainty of outcome. Even though some dont agree it has been working for us in the past an can contiue working for us to chose our president in the future.",1,5872ccb4bcff489484041677f367498b
"What is the electoral college?  The electoral college is a process which consists of the selection of the electors, meeting where they vote for president, and the counting of the votes.  The real question is, is the electoral college helping us or is it just bringing our government farther towards disaster? The electoral college should be diminished because it is an unfair direct election, and the disaster factor.

To begin, by keeping the electoral college we could avoid run off elections.  This would help our governmental system because as noted by Richard A. Posner, ""There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast.""  By keeping the electoral college, we could help resolve run-off elections.  What we dont know is if it will permanantly work for our governmental system and is it worth the risk? The electors are the ones voting for the president, so we should question whether they should have control to help avoid these run-off elections.  The writer notes, ""... the pressure would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by electoral college..."" (Posner).  Although that is true, that is only one problem that would be resolved by the electoral college, and olne benefit is outnumbered by the numerous disadvantages to the electoral college.

Moreover, the disaster facor has a huge impact on the electoral collage.  The writer states, ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse"" (Plumer).  This disaster was not the first disaster to happen in the system.  According to Plumer, the system has had much more effect and damage on the United States and this should not be repeated again.  The writer also says, ""electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please"" (Plumer).  This goes to show, not only is the electoral college unbeneficial, but they can be sneaky.  The electoral college should be abolished because of the atrocious outcomes it is capable of doing to our government.

Not only is the electoral college capable of the disaster factor, but it also has no direct election.  As stated in ""What Is the Electoral College?"", ""... when you vote for your candidate you are acually voting for your candidate's electors."" (Office of the Federal Register).  This means, voters have no control over whom controls the country.  That is outrageous that the lives of these people will be affected by someone they did not want in the overpowering decisions of their country. Writer Plumer states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair too voters"" as well as ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" (Plumer).  Both of these point go to show that the electoral college is lowering our hopes for the government.  The writer also notes, ""candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states"" (Plumer).  This proves that the electoral government thinks about their winning chances instead of our countries government.  Are we going to sit here and let them take advantage of their power that will lead us towards disaster?

All in all, the electoral collage should be banished from the government.  Who wants our government to get weaker and more unfair to the citizens?  By taking away the electoral college our government would gain back its strength and become the hard- working government we know it can be!",1,503c2da6f1fe413fb66e5ee73d136484
"Wouldn't it be remarkable if in the future, computers could read you facial expression and tell exactly how you feel? In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" We now know it's possible, and thanks to the latest innovation in the technology world to Proffesor Thomas Hauang it could be sooner than we think. This new software, known as the Facial Action Coding System, is able to read your emotional expressions which is shown to be very promising to the educational system. Reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is vauble becasue it could regonize if a student is bored or confused, it could also modify the lesson in order for the student to learn better.

First, this technology could be used to tell if student are confused, bored, happy etc. Shown in the article in the 6th paragraph the author states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huand predicts."" And prefaces by stating, ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be diffrent."" If applied in the educational sence this could mean that the computer could see the students is confused and be able to spend more time trying to help that student comprehend the material. The computer could also modify the lesson.

Additionally, If that doesn't work then it could always modify the lesson in a way the student could get a better meaning of it. In the article the author states, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The computer is able modify the lesson so the student. maybe even the whole class, could be sable to get a better under standing of the subject at hand. Also the author states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal""

"Cell phones have become an essential part of our lives, and it's not uncommon to see people using them everywhere, even while driving. However, the question remains whether drivers should be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. In my opinion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving, and I'll explain why.

First and foremost, using a cell phone while driving is a significant distraction. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), distracted driving was responsible for 3,166 deaths in the United States in 2017. Cell phone use is one of the most common forms of distracted driving, and it's easy to understand why. When drivers are on their phones, they're not paying attention to the road, and their reaction time is slowed down. This means that they're more likely to get into an accident, which could result in serious injury or even death.

Another reason why drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving is that it's a serious safety risk for pedestrians and other drivers. When drivers are distracted by their phones, they're less likely to see pedestrians crossing the street or other vehicles approaching. This could lead to tragic accidents that could have been avoided if the driver was paying attention to the road.

Furthermore, using a cell phone while driving is illegal in many states. According to the Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA), as of 2020, 48 states have banned text messaging for all drivers, and 20 states have banned hand-held phone use for all drivers. These laws have been put in place for a reason, and it's important for drivers to follow them to ensure the safety of everyone on the road.

Some people argue that drivers should be able to use their phones in emergency situations, such as when they need to call 911 or a family member. However, this argument is flawed because drivers can easily pull over to the side of the road or use a hands-free device, such as Bluetooth, to make the call. It's not necessary to hold the phone while driving, which eliminates the risk of distraction.

In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. The risks of distracted driving, safety risks for pedestrians and other drivers, and illegalities of cell phone use while driving all support this argument. It's important for drivers to prioritize safety on the road and avoid distractions, such as cell phones, to ensure the well-being of everyone on the road.",0,aea66b46999f4cd983b5f45060a55e53
"With the rapid development of technology, it is becoming increasingly easy to engage in online shopping. Online shopping has become a popular and convenient way for people to purchase goods from all over the world. While most people associate online shopping with convenience, ease of access, and variety of product options there are several potential risks that consumers should be aware of before making an online purchase. One risk associated with purchasing items over the internet is data security. Online retailers often collect personal information such as name, address, email address and credit card details when transactions occur which makes customers vulnerable to identity theft or fraudulent activity on their accounts. As a result, shoppers must practice safe internet browsing habits while searching for items they wish to buy whether it’s through researching the company’s privacy policy or taking steps such as using secure payment methods like PayPal or Apple Pay rather than entering your credit card information directly into an unfamiliar website's checkout page. Furthermore, shoppers should always check a site's trustworthiness by looking for customer reviews prior to making any purchases on new sites that they don't recognize so as not give away sensitive financial information without knowing if you can really trust them first. Another risk facing consumer who shop online pertains to delivery reliability; when buying something off the internet customers are essentially trusting third party companies like FedEx or UPS with delivering their item correctly and safely on-time even though in some cases products will take weeks (or months) longer than expected due to various reasons like extreme weather conditions or customs regulations etc… To help mitigate these risks buyers should always read up about different shipping policies offered by each store/website before committing  to make sure that their order will arrive promptly since many stores offer refund policies if packages do not reach within a certain time frame which may also vary depending on where you live geographically too! Additionally it may be beneficial for buyers who value speediness look into express courier services such as DHL Express instead since typically these types of service providers have

"Yes, I do agree with Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's statement, because people do fail over and over again without loosing enthusiasm.

I have good enthusiasm. For example I failed a lot of classes in high school and I had to repeat them I gave all of my best effort on every class I had to take even if I wasn't good at it or if I didn't like it because I don't want to keep repeating them just because I didn't try i have great confidence on every skill I have and i always try to improve them in a better way I ask for help to see what i need improve on and I eventually did get better and it was worth it because it made things much easier i understood all of the problems I had trouble with I brought my grades up on the class I was failing on i mostly got B's on the tests and quizzes it's way better than getting a D I was glad that I was making changes and improvement on my skills it was the best thing I have ever done.

I have dont ever give up, for example one time i remember i had to do make a little video game for my school project and as i was making it i didn't know what kind of video game to make i didn't have any ideas of what to make and i thought of giving up because i didn't know what to make and then i started thinking of making a first person shooting game and it was mostly like the game Call of Duty but i made a little change to it i put in the choices to choose any gun from the previous games it can be a gun from any Call of Duty game i feel like that was a good idea because some people would really like to have some of the old weapons back and they like a game that is boots on the ground and i also made a zombie game mode i put in some better things in that mode and i kept adding more details to the game and i am actually glad that i didn't give up because it tells me that I am not a quitter and that i wont be giving up so easily.

some people would disagree with Winston Churchill statement because they dont believe that failure would consist to success they think that if you fail your gonna fail again over and over no matter how hard you try your always gonna fail i know some people say that because i had a friend that literally gave up so fast it was pretty sad and i kept telling him that you have to keep trying there's no other choice you can do but push yourself and he didn't he just gave up and didn't even bother to try. However not everyone gives up so fast because they believe in themselves they don't loose their confidence even when they are not at their best they still wont give up because they know they can do better the next time they do it you just got to keep trying till you make it.

In my opinion, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more advantageous than specializing in one specific subject.

Firstly, having broad knowledge in many academic subjects can lead to a better understanding of the world around us. A person with diverse knowledge can relate to different fields, which is essential in understanding how different fields are connected. For instance, a person with a background in both science and history can understand how science and technology have evolved over time and how it has impacted our society. This knowledge can help them make informed decisions and think critically.

Secondly, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can help individuals in their career growth. As the world becomes more interconnected, employers are looking for employees who can bring different perspectives to the table. A person with diverse knowledge can adapt to different fields, which can help them excel in their careers. For example, a person with knowledge in computer science, business, and marketing can help a company develop an innovative product and market it effectively.

Thirdly, having broad knowledge in many academic subjects can help individuals in their personal growth. Learning about different subjects can help individuals develop critical thinking skills, problem-solving skills, and enhance their creativity. The more knowledge one has, the more equipped they are to face challenges in their personal lives.

On the other hand, specializing in one specific subject can also have it's advantages. It can lead to individuals becoming experts in their field, which can help them excel in their careers. However, it can also limit their perspective and prevent them from understanding the connections between different fields.

In conclusion, while specializing in one specific subject can have it's advantages, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more advantageous. It can lead to a better understanding of the world around us, help in career growth, and personal growth. In today's interconnected world, having diverse knowledge is essential, and individuals who can adapt to different fields are more likely to succeed. Therefore, it is important to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects.

"The importance of self-care should never be underestimated. As the fast pace of modern life continues to accelerate, it's easy for our own mental and physical health to take a back seat in favor of achieving goals or completing tasks. In order to remain healthy and balanced, it is essential that we prioritize regular self-care and make time for activities that bring joy into our lives. Self-care can come in many forms - from taking a long hot bath after a stressful day at work, to going on an invigorating run around the neighborhood. Whether big or small, these activities are more than just a way to relax; they are also important investments in ourselves and our overall wellbeing. Taking care of ourselves gives us the opportunity to recharge both mentally and physically which allows us to think more clearly, increase productivity, improve moods, reduce stress levels as well as strengthen relationships with those who matter most including family members as well as friends. Furthermore, by acknowledging our needs on an individual basis instead of neglecting them out of guilt or shame can help build up resilience against future challenges and setbacks that may arise during difficult times such as sicknesses or financial issues. In conclusion, self-care is often overlooked but has immense value when it comes down improving all aspects our lives from emotional support though increased confidence levels all the way through staying healthier longer throughout life itself! So why not start making some time for yourself today? Self-care really does go a long way when done properly - you deserve it!

"An industrial world without cars may seem to be ages away, but according to the studies conducted in the passages, the reduction of car use is very positive culturally, environmentally, and even economically.

One advantage of a society without cars is a relief of stress. The residents of Vauban, Germany, a car-free suburban town, are much happier there. They don't have to deal with the pollution of gas emission or noise pollution from traffic; they simply hear bicycles swishing by and children playing.

Car free towns have been an intriguing idea for years now; even major organizations like the Environmental Protection Agency and Transportation for America are willing to pursue car-free cities for many reasons. The major motivation for getting rid of cars is pollution. In Europe, 12% of gas emissions come from cars, and in some car-intensive areas in America, gas emissions from cars reach 50%. There was even a ban on driving in Paris for a short while when the smog became too hectic. That's a massive amount of pollution- an amount that can be greatly reduced.

Some countries are slowly getting on board with the whole ""car-free"" idea. In Bogota, there's a car free day where everyone takes alternative forms of transportation to get around, be it buses, bikes, or skateboards, which makes a huge difference in such a heavily populated metropolis. The citizens really enjoy this day, hinting that a car free life is more enjoyable. This car free day has even spread to other Colombian cities like Cali and Valledupar and will soon spread to other countries as well.

If a car free society is ideal, how come we don't have it yet? Currently, we still depend greatly on cars; giving them up wholly is a very radical change. However, governments are working into it slowly. On top of car-free towns like Vauban and car-free holidays like in Bogota, car-free cities are being planned. These cities would be very dense, making it easier to get around with a bike, on foot, or on public buses and metrorails rather than in a private car. This will reduce pollution greatly, spawn a healthier population, and even support local business growth now that local restaurants will be a walk away from one's home. Even today, cities have been favoring alternative transportation with tolls on cars that exempt bikes.

It is even evident in America that the amount of people getting drivers liscences has been dropping steadily. Culturally, everything is growing to be more local: carpools, public transportation, and the internet keep eveyone connected without having to use private cars.

In the final analysis, shifting towards a society that is less dependent on cars will bring about very positive results. People will be able to enjoy a more local, connected, and happier environment and nature will flourish too with the relief of pollution, both in the form of noise and gas emission. Hopefully, the reduction of car use will be well under way in the near future and we can progress, improving society and repairing the global ecosystem.",1,abade0495fe44988b3ede22ea98c169c
"We should abolish the Electoral College and change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. The Electoral College is corrupt compared to popular vote. They're more cons than pros about the Electoral College. A lot of people agree that we should change our voting to popular vote. Electoral College voting should not be the way we vote for something so important.

The Electoral College System is wrong. In source two, Bradford Plumer said that ""under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president"". You have no clue who your voting in with the Electoral College system. Plumer also said ""they can be anyone not holding public office"" and ""electors could always defy the will of the people"". Do you really want someone who you dont know and can't trust to be an elector? If you wanted someone like that you might as well let a child do the job. In source one the Office of the Federal Register said ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors"". More than one source said that you vote in electors when voting for a your candidate.

The Electoral College system is said to be unfair to voters in source two. The Electoral College system has a ""winnertakeall"" system. Which means if a Democrat candidate wins they will have Democrat electors and if a Republican wins the will have Republican electors. In source one the Office of the Federal Register also said that the ""winnertakeall"" system ""awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"". This is not fair to the voters or the United States. If a tie happened it would be even more unfair to voters. if a tie did happen the House of Representatives would break it. In source two Plumer said ""the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. If the voting doesnt even show your will why vote? Plumer also said in source two that ""the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". I agree with plumer, the electoral College needs to go.

Even though the Electoral College has a lot more cons than pros they have some pros. In source three Posner give you the ""five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"". Posner said the first reason was ""certainty of outcome"". The second reason is ""the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal"". the third and fourth reason is ""swing states"" and ""big states"". the fifth reason is the Electoral College system can ""avoid runoff elections"". These are all pros of keeping the Electroral College, but are they really worth it? Would you rather have these pros compared to having fairness?

We should abolish the Electoral College and change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. Popular voting is alot better for everyone. The pros of popular voting excedes the pros of the Electoral College. Popular voting gives everyone a fair chance and doesnt just have a ""winnertakeall"" system. it actually gives both political parties a chance. I agree with source two when it said ""Abolish the Electoral College!"".",1,bd7604fc38c94ea3a80a6af5fe154dec
"The importance of community service cannot be overstated. It can have a significant impact on the lives of those who dedicate their time to helping others, as well as the communities they serve. Community service activities such as volunteering at local animal shelters and soup kitchens, cleaning up parks and playgrounds, mentoring younger students or providing medical support for those in need are just some examples of ways that we can give back to our communities. When individuals take part in community service projects they gain invaluable skills that help them become more confident citizens while also learning important lessons about selflessness and compassion. Whether it is teaching basic computer skills to seniors or delivering meals to the homeless, these experiences often shape young people’s perspectives on life by showing them how much good they can do when they focus on helping others instead of themselves. Additionally, taking part in initiatives such as these can open new doors for networking opportunities which could lead to potential career paths or further educational pursuits within a field that previously may not have been considered by an individual person before participating in their project-related activities. Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of community service is how it brings people together from all walks of life with diverse backgrounds and beliefs working towards achieving common goals. By experiencing this unique form of unity first hand, participants learn just how powerful collaboration amongst different individuals with varying life experiences truly is – especially when everyone is pursuing a cause worth fighting for like improving access to healthcare resources or promoting literacy among lower-income families within their neighborhood . In addition , being involved in volunteer activities allows for local residents to engage directly with members from other neighborhoods which fosters greater political awareness between groups who would otherwise remain unaware due current socioeconomic inequalities present throughout many major urban areas across the nation today .

"Have you ever asked a friend or family member an important question? Have they ever given you an answer that gave you a far from ideal output? Nobody is always right, and many are far from being so. When you need advice on a subject, asking more than one person is always beneficial, because nobody is always correct, and it helps play to the human nature of skepticism and truth-seeking.

Firstly, one must get advice from more than one person because it helps to weed out the truth. In ancient times, people used to think that the earth was flat, and that the sun orbited the earth. This was, of course, inherently wrong, and eventually disproven by astronomers. But we would still believe those things today, if everybody blindly followed other's advice. Instead, these astronomers pushed through the cries of heresy to find the truth. They were skeptics. Speculation and skepticism breed creativity and the need for truth, two essential facets of human existance. You may think that this is getting a bit off-topic, but it actually mirrors the topic at hand. We must be skeptical of others advice, for taking bad advice can be extremely detrimental. And what better way to find the truth than to find a collection of them, and pull from that the correct thing to do? A person should get advice from different people, because it plays to the natural human trait of skepticism, which has long been found to be the pathway to truth. But this isnt the only reason one should gather the advice of more than one person.

In the times of the Oregon trail, there was a family that wanted to go west, to find new land to settle on. Most people at the time would go on the Oregon trail, a mapped trail to get to the west. But a family friend told them that he knew a guide who had a much better, easier route. The guide took them about halfway through this 'route', and then informed them that he would have to head back, as he had more groups to take. Shortly thereafter, the trail became much harder. They had to abandon their horse and wagon, and eventually, winter caught up with them. Stuck in a cabin they had found, with no food or water, the family perished. This is only a heavily abridged version of the true story, as the full tale is much more gruesome. The moral, perhaps, is that even people you trust can give you bad, if well-meaning, advice. It is doubted that the family friend even knew how unrepputable the guide was, but he still gave them the advice that eventually led to their deaths. Sometimes, people think that they give good advice, but unbenownst to them, the advice isn't so good at all. If the family had asked more people, they might have lived through that fatal winter.

To recap, to get the best opinion on something, one must ask multiple people, as a single person may be wrong. if you are given multiple possible solutions, then you can find the best one and go with it. The author implores you, next time you are having a tough time making a decision, to ask multiple people, to do research on the solutions given, and to not die in a cabin in the dead of winter.",1,ae2bb3d40ad24859a99d258d6a4655dd
"When it comes to the environment, green energy is becoming increasingly important. As conventional sources of fuel become more expensive and their environmental impacts become damaging, renewable energy sources are gaining traction as an economic and sustainable solution. Solar power specifically is a rapidly growing industry that shows no signs of slowing down in the near future. The use of solar energy offers a variety of advantages: it’s clean, with minimal emissions; its cost-effective, without requiring any burning of fossil fuels; and it’s abundant and freely available from our sun's rays - making it one of the most reliable renewable resources for powering homes, businesses, cities and even countries across the world. In addition to these benefits for consumers looking to lower their bills or reduce their carbon footprint, solar also provides jobs in research & development (R&D), manufacturing and installation which can often pay higher than average wages while enabling communities to benefit from energy independence. It’s clear there are many benefits associated with using solar power but what makes this technology so effective? The key lies in photovoltaic (PV) cells—components that generate electrical current when exposed to light—which convert sunlight into usable electricity at high efficiency rates regardless if cloudy days or night time conditions exist outside. PV panels come in all shapes & sizes too which means they can be easily incorporated into existing buildings or designed in new construction projects allowing flexibility depending on specific needs or demands. As we continue searching for ways to become more self-sufficient while improving our planet's health, investing in solar technology is quickly becoming one step towards achieving both aims simultaneously due its low impact nature yet undeniable effectiveness as an alternative source of electricity production. This influx of interest has consequently driven prices downward coupled with government incentives such as tax credits further encouraging adoption rates causing rapid growth within the industry overall thus helping promote sustainability goals on a global scale like never before seen!

"Dear Senator,

I believe that we should keep Electoral Colleges but massive changes to the system.  These changes would help prevent ties, avoid a large number of ""swing"" state, and also make elections easier.  For one to prevent ties, that is a hard thing to prevent cosidering we have no control over who someone votes for but it can be solved. If, in case of a tie, we due a tie braker as you will.  There will be a revotation process with 499 voters, these voters are picked at random in the city data base.  ""...for example, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him.""

Number 2 is to solve swing states, again this is something it is hard to prevent but can be solved.  There needs to be an equal number over information distributed among the states and so forth.  For the conclusion of making elections easier, we need to make the more convenient. It takes a long time to vote for you and could be faster.  Although the electoral system is slightly flawed we still need to keep the ""peoples"" president, and there are not manyn other ways to do this than to due the system we have now.  The only major problem is the the system is out of date.",1,4a19a0aa6f2e49c79da8c43659e7c2bb
"Seeking multiple opinions when making an important decision or choice can be very helpful for a few key reasons:

Different perspectives bring new insights. When we ask just one person for advice, we get a limited perspective based on that individual's experiences and point of view. However, life experiences vary greatly between people. By seeking opinions from several trusted sources, we gain access to a more well-rounded set of insights and perspectives on the issue at hand. Different people might focus on various important factors, positives or negatives that others may not have considered. This helps us make a more informed choice. 

Balanced recommendations. Individuals can sometimes be biased based on their personal relationships, preferences, or agendas. While well-meaning, a friend may provide advice that is skewed in our favor and misses some important downsides or objective trade-offs. Multiple advisors help ensure a more impartial analysis. They can point out considerations that balance each other out. If different people highlight similar important concerns, risks or recommendations, we can feel more confident about those factors in our decision making. 

Avoiding errors in judgment. No one is immune to erring in their evaluation or being ill-informed on some aspects tied to the choice. Consult just one advisor and their judgment could potentially include some misperceptions or gaps. However, if several independent advisors highlight similar counsel after applying their unique lenses, it reduces the chance of being misguided by any one individual's limitations or flaws in reasoning. The collective input of even just a few additional opinions helps safeguard against making a misinformed choice due to any single source of advice.

In summary, the diversity of perspectives, balanced impartiality, and cross-validation gained from seeking multiple opinions provide a much stronger foundation for decision making compared to relying on a lone advisor. This approach helps make well-informed choices that consider more complete pictures, reduce individual limitations and avoid potential pitfalls.",0,8c9f2b180a7e45afb6f322df97017050
"I believe that children should be taught to cooperate, as it is the most beneficial way to live. Cooperation allows for a more efficient and effective society, as it leads to a greater degree of cooperation and communication. Cooperation also allows for a more equitable distribution of resources, as everyone benefits from working together.

One of the best ways to teach children to cooperate is through competition. However, competition should only be used as a tool to motivate children and to ensure that they are working hard. Too often, competition becomes a way to judge children and to put them down. This is not only harmful to the children involved, but it also has negative consequences for society as a whole.

One of the most harmful consequences of competition is that it can lead to a sense of entitlement. Children who are taught to compete often believe that they are entitled to win, and they become unwilling to cooperate. This can have a negative impact on their academic performance and their social lives.

In addition, competition can lead to a sense of rivalry. Children who are taught to compete often become competitive with one another, which can lead to conflict and animosity. This can have a negative impact on their relationships with their peers and their family members.

Finally, competition can lead to a sense of entitlement and a lack of empathy. Children who are taught to compete often become self-centred and insensitive to the feelings of others. This can have a negative impact on their social and emotional development.

Therefore, I believe that children should be taught to cooperate, rather than to compete. This is the most beneficial way to live, as it leads to a greater degree of cooperation and communication, a more equitable distribution of resources, and a better social and emotional development.
