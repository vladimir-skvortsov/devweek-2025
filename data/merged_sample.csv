The following theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of large-scale neural networks has been proposed: the connection between the attention mechanism and the renormalization group, a mathematical framework that has been successful in describing the behavior of complex systems in physics, such as phase transitions and critical phenomena, suggests that the attention mechanism can be viewed as a type of'renormalization group flow' that captures the essential features of the underlying neural network dynamics. In this context, the fixed points of the renormalization group flow correspond to the attractors of the neural network dynamics, and the relevance of the renormalization group to the study of neural networks suggests that a deeper understanding of the renormalization group may provide new insights into the behavior of large-scale neural networks, potentially leading to a more profound understanding of the theoretical foundations of the transformer architecture and other deep neural networks.",0,148ff9d9450f4d6a8dbd9e760d7c2734

"I agree with NASA that the face was not made my aliens, and that it is a natural monument. My reasons are because the shadows are what makes it a face. Another reason is because you can really ress it unless there are shadows and your rihg tover it. My last reason is that Mars Global Surveyor Cyldonia took pictures of the Face and proved that it is natural.

The shadows give is it's face because there is bumps on mars, so that when shadows go a certain direction, it casts shadows and makes it look like a human face on Mars. In the article it says "" A few days late NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...whihc resembles a human head.. formed by shadows giving the illision of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The author reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and atrract attention to Mars."" This goes on to prove my next point.

Marc Global Surveyor Cyldonia has taken better picture of what they so call ""the Face"" on Mars.

It says

"" And so on April 5,1998, when Marz Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera(MOC) team snapped a picture tem time sharper than the original Viking photos. THousands of anxious web surfer were waiting when the image appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This goes to show that it was not formed by aliens and it was not created there on purpose.

My last reason is that you can really see it unless there is a shadow or you look at it at a exact angle. The article proved this by saying this "" Neerthe less, on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enought for a second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degees to center the Face in the feild view,"" said Garvin. ""Malin's team caputred an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resoltion."" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meter, compared to 43 meter per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This is proving that with a better camera and a better view that it was naturally made and you have to look at it from certain angles to see the face.

Yes, I agree with NASA that ""the Face"" is nothing but a natural landform, and not something created by life on a different planet. My reasons being the shadows are the only thing that gives it it's face, Mars Global Surveyor took better pictures of the landform, and you can't really see it unless you look from a certain agngle or direction.

"School uniforms have been a controversial topic in public schools for years. Many believe that school uniforms are beneficial and provide many positive aspects to the students, while others feel they stifle creativity and individual expression. This essay will discuss both sides of the debate, weighing out the pros and cons of incorporating mandatory school uniform policies within public institutions. One argument against implementing school uniforms is that it takes away from student’s individuality. By limiting what they can wear, students may feel restricted in their ability to express themselves through clothing choices. It could also lead to bullying as those without style or who cannot keep up with current trends become easily identifiable targets among peers in a group setting where everyone looks exactly alike. Furthermore, requiring all children to dress similarly could teach them conformity rather than encouraging creative thinking outside of the norm - something which should be encouraged within educational settings at an early age. On the other hand, proponents claim that introducing compulsory uniform policies reduces distractions and increases safety on campus grounds by eliminating differences between social statuses based on clothes worn each day; especially since most wealthy families are likely able to afford more fashionable items than those from lower income backgrounds would be able purchase for their kids due to financial restraints . Uniforms also make getting ready for school easier as parents no longer need worry about buying “trendy” clothes their child might not like after only wearing them once or twice before outgrowing them anyway; this ultimately saves money over time versus shopping constantly for new clothing amidst ever-changing fashion trends throughout childhood development stages. Additionally, when students look similar it helps create an atmosphere focused solely on learning instead of competing with peers over appearances or certain materials goods amongst one another during class hours which can help improve overall performance levels within educational institutions as well . . In conclusion , although requiring all students within public schools adhere to set guidelines concerning wardrobe attire has both its benefits and drawbacks . Ultimately , we must decide if any potential outcomes outweigh each other enough so we may

"In recent years, the use of electric vehicles (EVs) has become increasingly popular as a way to reduce environmental pollution. EVs are an efficient and eco-friendly alternative to traditional gas-powered cars, and their popularity is growing due to their numerous advantages over gasoline-powered vehicles. This essay will examine the role of EV technology in reducing air pollution, its economic savings for drivers, and how it can help protect the environment. The most obvious benefit of electric vehicles is that they produce significantly less emissions than traditional gas-powered vehicles. According to estimates from the EPA’s 2020 Vehicle Emissions Modeling tool, driving a traditional car produces more than twice as much greenhouse gases per mile compared with an EV powered by clean electricity sources such as wind or solar energy. Electric cars produce no tailpipe pollution whatsoever; this means that switching to an EV can help reduce smog and other types of air pollutants which contribute heavily to climate change and public health problems like asthma. Moreover, since EVs have no oil or lubricants that need changing there are fewer toxic materials being released into our environment overall – something not possible with gas engines!. . Additionally, those who switch from a petrol vehicle to an electric one may be able to save money in fuel costs over time due to reduced maintenance needs compared with internal combustion engines (ICE). An EV motor requires almost no maintenance throughout its lifetime when compared against ICE motors which require regular tune ups and oil changes every few thousand miles - leading up front cost savings despite higher purchase prices on some models! In addition, many governments offer tax credits for buying new or used EVs so you could potentially make back some expenses incurring while purchasing your vehicle too! Finally, depending on energy rates where you live charging an EV at home overnight may also cost significantly less than refuelling a conventional car at your local petrol station each week – so those looking for long term cost savings should definitely consider going electric!. Finally it's important we recognize

Graduating early can be a great opportunity for high school students. Not only does it help to reduce their high school workload, but it can also give them a chance to get a jump-start on their college career. With graduation comes the potential to start college classes sooner, create a more well-rounded college application, and to become better prepared for the demands of college-level work.

To succeed in taking advantage of the opportunity to graduate early, students must plan ahead. As soon as they decide that they are interested in graduating early, they can begin researching the options that their school has available. They may need to look into accelerated courses, available dual-enrollment programs, or other options that their school can offer. It is important to take the time to ask questions and research the potential benefits and drawbacks of each option before selecting one. Doing so can help make sure students are prepared for the increased workload and complexity that comes with taking accelerated classes.

For students who are looking to get a jump-start on their college career, graduating early can be an excellent opportunity. With proper planning and dedication, students can take advantage of the opportunity to reduce their high school load and get a head start on their educational pursuits.",0,a5a5d59026974aefa40cdbe8504760b1
"Do you think it is more beneficial to work in groups? Do you think working in groups makes you focus? Do you think working in groups is easy and fun?.

Do you think working in groups is more easier?. May people will say No and others will say yes to all these four question. working in groups is more beneficial than working alone. I think working in groups is more beneficial and good for many reasons because; we collaborate and share ideas, it more fun and easy working together and get a chance to work with people we really dont talk to. and we also get our project or work done on time.

Working in groups helps us by sharing ideas: i think working in groups is very important. it helps us bring our minds together to brainstorm some ideas or by sharing opinoin about the project or the assignment we are working on. we can discuss and make sure we understand and know the topic that we are working on. by doing this is a great thing because every person is contributing or participating in what we are working on.

Secondly, We get everything organized and get our things done on time: working alone somethings is very terrible because i takes a while to finsh, you dont get it done on time and sometimes you might need help from somebody, which sucks but working in groups more quicker. since there is about atleast three or four people in the group. it makes it more faster to get it done on time. it makes it even more easier to get the assignment done by contributing and aslo,

assigning or giving each and every person in the group a role to play or something to do to support the group in order to get it done on time.

Lastly, another reason why working in groups is beneficial is because it is easy and fun working together and let us get a chance to work with some people you really dont talk to in school. Most people likes dont like to socialize with people they dont know so they choose to work alone. which is okay,

but i think working as groups fun and easy. plus ,

it is very beneficial. I feel like working in groups is more fun. it makes us feel more free and more open to work together. when working with a group of people it is more fun because someone in the group may crack a joke or say something funny, it might cause a little bit of distraction but it brings laughter, smile, joy and happiness into our faces and that is what makes more fun and exciting to work together as a group.

In conlcusion, it is more beneficial working in groups than working alone. In groups we share ideas, we finish on time before due date and it is more fun and easy to work together with people but not just by yourself. because in groups we disscuss and make sure everyone in the group understand before we start putting effort in what we are about to do. it is very important to work together in groups because it tells us that we should encourage ourselves and work together as a team. And by showing a team work, hardwork , support and determination makes a group work more successful.            ",1,afc5a4cda3f54327a7e305cc268a4105
"Dear state senator, Ever since 1776, The United States of America has been a great example of freedom, excellence, and democracy. After all, the U.S. is one of the biggest supporters of democracy, and is all about the rights of their people. So imagine my shock to learn that this country, in fact, does not rely on it's people to vote for their leader. Which, to many people would be the simplest form of freedom out there. Instead, we have the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a number of electors that represent a state. ""Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...."" What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register In this quote, it explains that the Electoral College is based on the existing population in your state therefore, the more people you have, the more electors the state receives. However, this sounds great and all, but in my opinion, a direct democracy would work great for this country because it would generate just representation of the people by allowing them to make the vote, encourage voters and remind them that they have a voice, and immediately destroy the chances of a representative to vote for an opposing candidate.

America is all about their people. And of course, the government wants to do what's best for them, right? Voting is a right that American citizens achieve when they reach the matured age of eighteen. It's supposed to feel like a blessing that we get to decide and have a voice in the process of election. But, with the Electoral College, it ""...may turn off potential voters of a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state."" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner So the citizens of this country are beginning to feel like their say in this decision will have little to no impact. This will affect the amount of voters and will ultimately cause a huge problem in the way people feel about representation.

Enough about the people, how about the electors? ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer This means that not even when the people vote for all their electors and they should be selecting the correct candidate, they may change their minds. Electors are people too, and people may have their opinions swayed and then the electors could vote for the other candidate. It is scary to think that the candidate everyone chose and was rooting for might not win because someone decided to make a different decision.

And some people might stand up for the Electoral College, say that ""The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates...to focus their campain efforts on the tossup states."" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner It later goes on to say that because of this, the citizens in the Swing States become the most thoughtful voters because they receive the most information on the candidates. However, wouldn't we, as a country, prefer all of our potential voters to be informed and wellaware of our candidates? ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states...focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer Why should the fate of the presidency be laid in the hands of such a small amount of people when our country is meant to be for everybody in the land?

As a concluding statement, senator, I want you to consider my argument that we'd be better off without the Electoral College because citizens should be able to decide who they want to run, they should feel important, they should all be wellinformed, and electors that change their minds wouldn't even be a problem anymore. Thank you for taking the time to consider my letter.",1,6199e39bd9f24371b5e5e40dbb14c3de
"Personally, I believe that there are many advantages to limiting usage of a motor vehicle. There would be less air pollution, quicker public transportation, and more social contact.

Firstly, as stated in almost every article the main goal of stopping people from driving their cars was that their was too much air pollution going on throughout these cities. There was a nearrecord days of pollution which made some cities in Europe decide the make partial laws to restrict people from using their cars all the time. Personally I think that is a great idea to stop people from driving cars. People not driving cars all the time benefits everyone because the air pollution would eventually be hazardous to everyone leading to casualties and deaths.

Secondly, public transportation would be so much easier to get around with since there is barely traffic around. Could you imagine how easy it would be to get around using the bus or a taxi since there would be no traffic jams or accidents on the road. Of course since basically no one would have the accessibility to cars there would be much more public transportation but i doubt it would amount up to how many single cars you see on the road.

Also, one article stated that, Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" meaning that all this occurred due to the dramatic change in everyone driving their cars. I believe that this happened as a social thing because of everyone is always alone in their motor vehicle driving past everyone without a word said, rather than walking past a person with a smile on your face and making face to face contact. Usually the parks and sports centers are getting all these people in there because everyone walking or biking would pass by a park and say that they would want to hang out there for a minute since they hadn't been before or just walk in it to check it out since its on the way.

In Conclusion this is what i think of the advantages of limiting car usage. I think its good for the environment, makes public transportation quicker, and makes people more social.",1,1137872fb63c4dada089fc2cbb442e38
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author writes about a great number problems that come along with trying to get information on the our planetary neighbor, Venus. We, the readers, learn in detail about the specific challenges that come along with studying Venus, even with its close proximity to us. Despite the author describing all of the struggles that come along with studying our sister planet, the passage still supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthwile pursuit, through giving us strong examples of useful information we could learn, and describing safer and easier ways that we could study it that would make it far more simple to get the desired data.

While there are certainly many difficulties that the passage describes about getting information from Venus, the author thoroughly explains all of the great scientific benefits that we could get out of a Venus mission. As the author describes in paragraph four, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Not only will information about Venus teach us more about the universe around us, it might just be useful in order to study our own planet. Being able to learn so much from what a previous Earth could have been like would be a massive benefit to fields like history, and the earth sciences. The author goes into even more detail about this just afterward, describing how ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Not only are they similar from a geological perspective, it could provide vital information to the studies of biology, and possibly even support details about where we came from to begin with. There are hundreds, if not thousands of scientists specifically studying the cosmos trying to find planets with water that even have a small chance of supporting any form of life. The potential for further discovery here only a short distance away is extrodinary, and the author wisely emphasizes this through the passage.

Not only is the possibility for fascinating exploration and gaining crucial information about the Earth from Venus supported, the author also makes the important point that we are coming closer and closer by the day to this becoming a reality. In the seventh paragraph the author discusses this idea. ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" When they put some of the brightest engineers in the world to a specific task of making electronics that could survive in Venus, the results were successful, as they made them able to survive for almost a month. While a month doesn't sound like a long time for the equipment to last, the author mentions later on in the passage that ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme phyisical conditions."" The most delicate part any device that would land on Venus would be the electronics inside any rover or measuring equipment. The great advances in the durability of these electronics points toward an optimistic future in devices designed for Venus, as we are already seeing incredible progess being made. However, what would happen if they couldn't find a way around the delicacy of modern computers? The author proves that wouldn't be the end of our Venus hopes, that mechanical computers can be utilized in order to avoid easily broken hardware. Even in the worst case scenerio, our scientists are still devising ways to land a probe on Venus.

Though the author presents some great challenges in getting samples and other data from Venus, he strongly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit through the development of new and better ways to survive the harsh atmosphere, and information that could be gained from it that is useful to studying scientific and historical fields back here on Earth that he mentions in the passage. The human race, throughout history, has always remained curious and are willing to sacrifice and go through long periods of experimentation to acheieve knowledge. We have faced these struggles as humans before, and this will not be the struggle that stops us.",1,6ea121bd530345a59ff929db3b4ad06b

"One topic that people debate a lot is that students expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. they courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. I think is not a good idea for a student to commit to a career at a young age. because students are not old enough they careless and not make the best decision when they at a young age.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because, students are not old enough to know what they career in specific. they not prepared for the world students in high school don't have any experience of any career.

I think is a little to early. I will explore all type of career when my senior junior year starts I would make sure to select the right courses and the better one to be prepared or have experience for your career.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because sometimes teenagers are careless something may go wrong with your life or you just wanna do something new. all those classes that I selected from freshman year are not gonna be worth it because you gonna have to take new classes. for example my friend selected a technology class in freshman year, and he search it up how much they make in a year and that was not what he expected. so he change to materials and process to learn how to cut, and built houses.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because, when you are in a young are you make the wrong decision well sometimes but I think the best decision for me during high school is to to wait and study the better classes and the best and better career. and to be able to do that you have to care about classes and be responsible with school and career.

As you read you can see the reasons,I think the best idea for students is to focus in high school and get good grades when you get to senior year or college, you know more about life and careers I think that would be the best time to selected the best classes that are gonna guide you toward a specific career.",1,861a72418247450abd59bbf4bcf4a555
"Why the Electoral College Should be Replaced

Dear Mr. Senator, ever since the Presidential Election of 2000, the concept of our electoral college has been highly scrutinized, and this is rightly so. The electoral college is undemocratic, unfair, and should be replaced with the popular vote.

Even people who support keeping the electoral college (such as the author of

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , Richard A. Posner) agree that ""...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense.."" (paragraph 15). America was founded on democracy and making sure that the people's voices were heard, and not allowing the people to directly vote for the leader of the country goes against that.

The electoral college is also extremely unfair to voters. Because of how the election system is set up, a candidate could win the people's popular vote, but not the electoral votes and would then not recieve presidency. This occured in 2000 in the Gore vs Busch election. Even though a majority of people voted for Gore, Busch still ended up with the presidency (paragraph 9). Having the electoral votes take pecedence over the popular vote takes away the people's voice and bscially tells them that their opinion doesn't matter as much as the electoral college's opinion.

The electoral college is also unfair because it discourages campaigning in non-swing states. A democratic candidate would not campaign in a state like California that is heavily democratic because they know they are almost definitley going to win the election in that state, meaning they will get all of that state's electoral votes. A republican candidate would not campaign in Caliornia either because they know they would have almost no chance of winning in such a heavily democratic state, and they would be wasting campaign money with no hope of electoral votes from that state (paragraph 13). This means that people in non-swing states like California don't really know much about either candidate because they were never informed. Then the people in these states tend to vote for their party solely because they have nothing else to go off of. It is unfair for voters in non-swing states to be left in the dark just because all of the electoral votes are almost guaranteed to go one way. If the US used popular votes for the Presidential Election, republicans in democratic states and democrats in republican states would have a voice too.

Another way the electoral college is unfair, is the standing procedure in the event of a tie. There are 538 electors in the electoral college (paragraph 3) which is an even number, meaning the electoral votes for each candidate could be tied. In the event of a tie, the House of Representatives would have an election and each state would get one vote. That would mean ""...the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"" (paragraph 12). This would make someone from California's vote count for much less than someone from Wyomig's vote.

It can be argued that the electoral college is beneficial in the fact that the winning candidate's share of electoral votes exceeds his share of popular votes. For example, in the 2012 election, Obama recieved 61.7% of the electoral votes compared to 51.3% of popular votes (paragraph 18). Some say this is beneficial because it reduces the chance of a dispute of vote counting. However, this is actually not a good thing. 51.3% of people wanted Obama to be President. Not 61.7%. Yet Obama still got credit for 61.7%. About 10% of voters who didn't support Obama didn't get their opinion heard.

The electoral college has been around for a long time, and it's time for a change. It is simply undemocratic and unfair. It prevents every person for having an equally weighted vote. The electoral college needs to be replaced with a popular vote.

Thank you for your time Mr. Senator.

"Automobiles have proved to be very convenient to our modern day society. It allows people to travel 20 miles in ten to fifteen minutes. By foot, it would take about four hours to travel that distance. Although cars have been beneficial, the limitation of car usage would outweigh the benefits of constantly relying on them. Decreasing the amount of time we spend in them would improve public transportation, improve air quality, and create less stress.

Cutting down the amount of car usage would encourage the use of public transportation. According to Source 1, the essentially car-less suburban, Vanbaun, has made public transportation more accessible. Increasing the use of it would decrease the time it takes to commute from place to place. Less cars on the roads mean less traffic. In small towns, not as many people currently use the system on a regular basis. With the limiting of car usage, public transportation could become more popular in suburban areas, not just metropolitan cities. Some may not want to take this form of transportation because it may not meet their sanitary needs. However, if the popularity increases, cities will be obligated to improve the conditions. Public transportation could be the new primary form of transportation if we limit the amount of time cars are allowed to be used.

Additionally, a large problem in the world today is air pollution and globabl warming. Automobiles cause the majority of this ongoing problem. Less time spent in the car would eventually lead to better air quality. Source 2 states that in Paris, France the smog in the city was near-record pollution. This caused Paris to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air. Congestion was cut down 60% after this action was taken. Vehicles release numerous harmful greenhouse gases that we have been trying to reduce. These gases not only harm the environment, but the people as well. New and popular alternatives to the common diesel cars are hybrids and electric cars. Less car usage would result in reduction of pollution.

Also, using a car less decreases stress levels. According to Source 3, in Bogota, Colombia, citizens participate in the very popular car-free day. A businessman in Colombia said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress."" Cars do not allow people's mind to stop and rest. A driver's mind is constantly thinking and attempting to get to their destination as fast as possible. If cars were barely used, people could take a serene stroll to their destination, allowing the mind to slow down, think, and relax. Parks and recreation would expand and improve as well due to the smaller vicinity we can reach by foot or bike. New and improved public areas would become more enjoyable, making us less stressed. Stress levels decline as car usage declines.

The increased use of public transportation, improved air quality, and lower stress levels all result from the limitations of car usage. As beneficial as a car may be to people, limiting the use of it is more advantageous than not. Car companies are still widely developing as highways and roads are expanding, but our society should go the other direction and find healthier sources of transportation.",1,6b71485f52ef45a4be2d80dfecceeb2c
"We should keep our method of chosing a president even though many dont agree because of a few reasons. One, big states. Two, avoid run off elections. Finnaly, to determine the certainty of outcome.

First, the issue of big states. States are put in two categories, big states and small states, according to population. Presidential candidates give more of their attention during the campaign to the larger states. As a result of electoral college the big states have more electors and thus more votes. For example, in Forida, the popular vote was extremely close in 2012, Obama who won, got 29 electoral votes. If obama had spent that time in Wyoming, he would have only had gotten 3 electoral votes.

Second, to avoid run off elections. Using the electoral college we avoid the problem of elections where no candidate receives a majority. the electoral college can produce a clear winner rather than pressure when no candidate wins majority and complications of the process. Two examples of this in 1968 and 1992 with president nixon and president Clinton. They both had 43 percent plurality of popular vote, while winning a majority of electoral college.

Finnally, to determine Certainty of outcome. Since, almost all states have electoral votes on a winner takes all basis, even the slightest plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state. Although, it is possible to have a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college, for instance in 20000, it is much less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. And even though a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes is an even number of 538, it is extremely unlikely to happen.

You could argue that the method of selecting a president through Electoral college may turn off potential voters for a candidate that has no hope if carrying their state, knowing their vote will have no effect. Then they might have less incentive to pay attention to the campaigngn. But being realistic, no voters one vote swings a national election, and about one half of the eligible American population did vote in 2012's election.

In conclusion, the reasons we shoud kee our current method of chosng the countries president is becuause of big states, to avoid run off elections, and to determine he certainty of outcome. Even though some dont agree it has been working for us in the past an can contiue working for us to chose our president in the future.",1,5872ccb4bcff489484041677f367498b
"What is the electoral college?  The electoral college is a process which consists of the selection of the electors, meeting where they vote for president, and the counting of the votes.  The real question is, is the electoral college helping us or is it just bringing our government farther towards disaster? The electoral college should be diminished because it is an unfair direct election, and the disaster factor.

To begin, by keeping the electoral college we could avoid run off elections.  This would help our governmental system because as noted by Richard A. Posner, ""There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast.""  By keeping the electoral college, we could help resolve run-off elections.  What we dont know is if it will permanantly work for our governmental system and is it worth the risk? The electors are the ones voting for the president, so we should question whether they should have control to help avoid these run-off elections.  The writer notes, ""... the pressure would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by electoral college..."" (Posner).  Although that is true, that is only one problem that would be resolved by the electoral college, and olne benefit is outnumbered by the numerous disadvantages to the electoral college.

Moreover, the disaster facor has a huge impact on the electoral collage.  The writer states, ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse"" (Plumer).  This disaster was not the first disaster to happen in the system.  According to Plumer, the system has had much more effect and damage on the United States and this should not be repeated again.  The writer also says, ""electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please"" (Plumer).  This goes to show, not only is the electoral college unbeneficial, but they can be sneaky.  The electoral college should be abolished because of the atrocious outcomes it is capable of doing to our government.

Not only is the electoral college capable of the disaster factor, but it also has no direct election.  As stated in ""What Is the Electoral College?"", ""... when you vote for your candidate you are acually voting for your candidate's electors."" (Office of the Federal Register).  This means, voters have no control over whom controls the country.  That is outrageous that the lives of these people will be affected by someone they did not want in the overpowering decisions of their country. Writer Plumer states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair too voters"" as well as ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" (Plumer).  Both of these point go to show that the electoral college is lowering our hopes for the government.  The writer also notes, ""candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states"" (Plumer).  This proves that the electoral government thinks about their winning chances instead of our countries government.  Are we going to sit here and let them take advantage of their power that will lead us towards disaster?

All in all, the electoral collage should be banished from the government.  Who wants our government to get weaker and more unfair to the citizens?  By taking away the electoral college our government would gain back its strength and become the hard- working government we know it can be!",1,503c2da6f1fe413fb66e5ee73d136484
"Wouldn't it be remarkable if in the future, computers could read you facial expression and tell exactly how you feel? In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" We now know it's possible, and thanks to the latest innovation in the technology world to Proffesor Thomas Hauang it could be sooner than we think. This new software, known as the Facial Action Coding System, is able to read your emotional expressions which is shown to be very promising to the educational system. Reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is vauble becasue it could regonize if a student is bored or confused, it could also modify the lesson in order for the student to learn better.

First, this technology could be used to tell if student are confused, bored, happy etc. Shown in the article in the 6th paragraph the author states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huand predicts."" And prefaces by stating, ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be diffrent."" If applied in the educational sence this could mean that the computer could see the students is confused and be able to spend more time trying to help that student comprehend the material. The computer could also modify the lesson.

Additionally, If that doesn't work then it could always modify the lesson in a way the student could get a better meaning of it.

"Cell phones have become an essential part of our lives, and it's not uncommon to see people using them everywhere, even while driving. However, the question remains whether drivers should be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. In my opinion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving, and I'll explain why.

First and foremost, using a cell phone while driving is a significant distraction. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), distracted driving was responsible for 3,166 deaths in the United States in 2017. Cell phone use is one of the most common forms of distracted driving, and it's easy to understand why. When drivers are on their phones, they're not paying attention to the road, and their reaction time is slowed down. This means that they're more likely to get into an accident, which could result in serious injury or even death.

Another reason why drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving is that it's a serious safety risk for pedestrians and other drivers. When drivers are distracted by their phones, they're less likely to see pedestrians crossing the street or other vehicles approaching. This could lead to tragic accidents that could have been avoided if the driver was paying attention to the road.

Furthermore, using a cell phone while driving is illegal in many states. According to the Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA), as of 2020, 48 states have banned text messaging for all drivers, and 20 states have banned hand-held phone use for all drivers. These laws have been put in place for a reason, and it's important for drivers to follow them to ensure the safety of everyone on the road.

Some people argue that drivers should be able to use their phones in emergency situations, such as when they need to call 911 or a family member. However, this argument is flawed because drivers can easily pull over to the side of the road or use a hands-free device, such as Bluetooth, to make the call. It's not necessary to hold the phone while driving, which eliminates the risk of distraction.

In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. The risks of distracted driving, safety risks for pedestrians and other drivers, and illegalities of cell phone use while driving all support this argument. It's important for drivers to prioritize safety on the road and avoid distractions, such as cell phones, to ensure the well-being of everyone on the road.",0,aea66b46999f4cd983b5f45060a55e53
"With the rapid development of technology, it is becoming increasingly easy to engage in online shopping. Online shopping has become a popular and convenient way for people to purchase goods from all over the world. While most people associate online shopping with convenience, ease of access, and variety of product options there are several potential risks that consumers should be aware of before making an online purchase. One risk associated with purchasing items over the internet is data security. Online retailers often collect personal information such as name, address, email address and credit card details when transactions occur which makes customers vulnerable to identity theft or fraudulent activity on their accounts. As a result, shoppers must practice safe internet browsing habits while searching for items they wish to buy whether it’s through researching the company’s privacy policy or taking steps such as using secure payment methods like PayPal or Apple Pay rather than entering your credit card information directly into an unfamiliar website's checkout page. Furthermore, shoppers should always check a site's trustworthiness by looking for customer reviews prior to making any purchases on new sites that they don't recognize so as not give away sensitive financial information without knowing if you can really trust them first. Another risk facing consumer who shop online pertains to delivery reliability; when buying something off the internet customers are essentially trusting third party companies like FedEx or UPS with delivering their item correctly and safely on-time even though in some cases products will take weeks (or months) longer than expected due to various reasons like extreme weather conditions or customs regulations etc… To help mitigate these risks buyers should always read up about different shipping policies offered by each store/website before committing  to make sure that their order will arrive promptly since many stores offer refund policies if packages do not reach within a certain time frame which may also vary depending on where you live geographically too! Additionally it may be beneficial for buyers who value speediness look into express courier services such as DHL Express instead since typically these types of service providers have

"Yes, I do agree with Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's statement, because people do fail over and over again without loosing enthusiasm.

I have good enthusiasm. For example I failed a lot of classes in high school and I had to repeat them I gave all of my best effort on every class I had to take even if I wasn't good at it or if I didn't like it because I don't want to keep repeating them just because I didn't try i have great confidence on every skill I have and i always try to improve them in a better way I ask for help to see what i need improve on and I eventually did get better and it was worth it because it made things much easier i understood all of the problems I had trouble with I brought my grades up on the class I was failing on i mostly got B's on the tests and quizzes it's way better than getting a D I was glad that I was making changes and improvement on my skills it was the best thing I have ever done.

I have dont ever give up, for example one time i remember i had to do make a little video game for my school project and as i was making it i didn't know what kind of video game to make i didn't have any ideas of what to make and i thought of giving up because i didn't know what to make and then i started thinking of making a first person shooting game and it was mostly like the game Call of Duty but i made a little change to it i put in the choices to choose any gun from the previous games it can be a gun from any Call of Duty game i feel like that was a good idea because some people would really like to have some of the old weapons back and they like a game that is boots on the ground and i also made a zombie game mode i put in some better things in that mode and i kept adding more details to the game and i am actually glad that i didn't give up because it tells me that I am not a quitter and that i wont be giving up so easily.

some people would disagree with Winston Churchill statement because they dont believe that failure would consist to success they think that if you fail your gonna fail again over and over no matter how hard you try your always gonna fail i know some people say that because i had a friend that literally gave up so fast it was pretty sad and i kept telling him that you have to keep trying there's no other choice you can do but push yourself and he didn't he just gave up and didn't even bother to try. However not everyone gives up so fast because they believe in themselves they don't loose their confidence even when they are not at their best they still wont give up because they know they can do better the next time they do it you just got to keep trying till you make it.

"Education is the foundation of our lives. It plays a significant role in shaping our future and determining our success. The question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject has been a topic of debate for a long time. Some believe that having broad knowledge is essential, while others argue that it is better to specialize in one area. In my opinion, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more advantageous than specializing in one specific subject.

Firstly, having broad knowledge in many academic subjects can lead to a better understanding of the world around us. A person with diverse knowledge can relate to different fields, which is essential in understanding how different fields are connected. For instance, a person with a background in both science and history can understand how science and technology have evolved over time and how it has impacted our society. This knowledge can help them make informed decisions and think critically.

Secondly, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can help individuals in their career growth. As the world becomes more interconnected, employers are looking for employees who can bring different perspectives to the table. A person with diverse knowledge can adapt to different fields, which can help them excel in their careers. For example, a person with knowledge in computer science, business, and marketing can help a company develop an innovative product and market it effectively.

Thirdly, having broad knowledge in many academic subjects can help individuals in their personal growth. Learning about different subjects can help individuals develop critical thinking skills, problem-solving skills, and enhance their creativity. The more knowledge one has, the more equipped they are to face challenges in their personal lives.

On the other hand, specializing in one specific subject can also have it's advantages. It can lead to individuals becoming experts in their field, which can help them excel in their careers. However, it can also limit their perspective and prevent them from understanding the connections between different fields.

In conclusion, while specializing in one specific subject can have it's advantages, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more advantageous. It can lead to a better understanding of the world around us, help in career growth, and personal growth. In today's interconnected world, having diverse knowledge is essential, and individuals who can adapt to different fields are more likely to succeed. Therefore, it is important to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects.

"The importance of self-care should never be underestimated. As the fast pace of modern life continues to accelerate, it's easy for our own mental and physical health to take a back seat in favor of achieving goals or completing tasks. In order to remain healthy and balanced, it is essential that we prioritize regular self-care and make time for activities that bring joy into our lives. Self-care can come in many forms - from taking a long hot bath after a stressful day at work, to going on an invigorating run around the neighborhood. Whether big or small, these activities are more than just a way to relax; they are also important investments in ourselves and our overall wellbeing. Taking care of ourselves gives us the opportunity to recharge both mentally and physically which allows us to think more clearly, increase productivity, improve moods, reduce stress levels as well as strengthen relationships with those who matter most including family members as well as friends. Furthermore, by acknowledging our needs on an individual basis instead of neglecting them out of guilt or shame can help build up resilience against future challenges and setbacks that may arise during difficult times such as sicknesses or financial issues. In conclusion, self-care is often overlooked but has immense value when it comes down improving all aspects our lives from emotional support though increased confidence levels all the way through staying healthier longer throughout life itself! So why not start making some time for yourself today? Self-care really does go a long way when done properly - you deserve it!

"An industrial world without cars may seem to be ages away, but according to the studies conducted in the passages, the reduction of car use is very positive culturally, environmentally, and even economically.

One advantage of a society without cars is a relief of stress. The residents of Vauban, Germany, a car-free suburban town, are much happier there. They don't have to deal with the pollution of gas emission or noise pollution from traffic; they simply hear bicycles swishing by and children playing.

Car free towns have been an intriguing idea for years now; even major organizations like the Environmental Protection Agency and Transportation for America are willing to pursue car-free cities for many reasons. The major motivation for getting rid of cars is pollution. In Europe, 12% of gas emissions come from cars, and in some car-intensive areas in America, gas emissions from cars reach 50%. There was even a ban on driving in Paris for a short while when the smog became too hectic. That's a massive amount of pollution- an amount that can be greatly reduced.

Some countries are slowly getting on board with the whole ""car-free"" idea. In Bogota, there's a car free day where everyone takes alternative forms of transportation to get around, be it buses, bikes, or skateboards, which makes a huge difference in such a heavily populated metropolis. The citizens really enjoy this day, hinting that a car free life is more enjoyable. This car free day has even spread to other Colombian cities like Cali and Valledupar and will soon spread to other countries as well.

If a car free society is ideal, how come we don't have it yet? Currently, we still depend greatly on cars; giving them up wholly is a very radical change. However, governments are working into it slowly. On top of car-free towns like Vauban and car-free holidays like in Bogota, car-free cities are being planned. These cities would be very dense, making it easier to get around with a bike, on foot, or on public buses and metrorails rather than in a private car. This will reduce pollution greatly, spawn a healthier population, and even support local business growth now that local restaurants will be a walk away from one's home. Even today, cities have been favoring alternative transportation with tolls on cars that exempt bikes.

It is even evident in America that the amount of people getting drivers liscences has been dropping steadily. Culturally, everything is growing to be more local: carpools, public transportation, and the internet keep eveyone connected without having to use private cars.

In the final analysis, shifting towards a society that is less dependent on cars will bring about very positive results. People will be able to enjoy a more local, connected, and happier environment and nature will flourish too with the relief of pollution, both in the form of noise and gas emission. Hopefully, the reduction of car use will be well under way in the near future and we can progress, improving society and repairing the global ecosystem.",1,abade0495fe44988b3ede22ea98c169c
"We should abolish the Electoral College and change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. The Electoral College is corrupt compared to popular vote. They're more cons than pros about the Electoral College. A lot of people agree that we should change our voting to popular vote. Electoral College voting should not be the way we vote for something so important.

The Electoral College System is wrong. In source two, Bradford Plumer said that ""under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president"". You have no clue who your voting in with the Electoral College system. Plumer also said ""they can be anyone not holding public office"" and ""electors could always defy the will of the people"". Do you really want someone who you dont know and can't trust to be an elector? If you wanted someone like that you might as well let a child do the job. In source one the Office of the Federal Register said ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors"". More than one source said that you vote in electors when voting for a your candidate.

The Electoral College system is said to be unfair to voters in source two. The Electoral College system has a ""winnertakeall"" system. Which means if a Democrat candidate wins they will have Democrat electors and if a Republican wins the will have Republican electors. In source one the Office of the Federal Register also said that the ""winnertakeall"" system ""awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"". This is not fair to the voters or the United States. If a tie happened it would be even more unfair to voters. if a tie did happen the House of Representatives would break it. In source two Plumer said ""the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. If the voting doesnt even show your will why vote? Plumer also said in source two that ""the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". I agree with plumer, the electoral College needs to go.

Even though the Electoral College has a lot more cons than pros they have some pros. In source three Posner give you the ""five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"". Posner said the first reason was ""certainty of outcome"". The second reason is ""the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal"". the third and fourth reason is ""swing states"" and ""big states"". the fifth reason is the Electoral College system can ""avoid runoff elections"". These are all pros of keeping the Electroral College, but are they really worth it? Would you rather have these pros compared to having fairness?

We should abolish the Electoral College and change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. Popular voting is alot better for everyone. The pros of popular voting excedes the pros of the Electoral College. Popular voting gives everyone a fair chance and doesnt just have a ""winnertakeall"" system. it actually gives both political parties a chance. I agree with source two when it said ""Abolish the Electoral College!"".",1,bd7604fc38c94ea3a80a6af5fe154dec
"The importance of community service cannot be overstated. It can have a significant impact on the lives of those who dedicate their time to helping others, as well as the communities they serve. Community service activities such as volunteering at local animal shelters and soup kitchens, cleaning up parks and playgrounds, mentoring younger students or providing medical support for those in need are just some examples of ways that we can give back to our communities. When individuals take part in community service projects they gain invaluable skills that help them become more confident citizens while also learning important lessons about selflessness and compassion. Whether it is teaching basic computer skills to seniors or delivering meals to the homeless, these experiences often shape young people’s perspectives on life by showing them how much good they can do when they focus on helping others instead of themselves. Additionally, taking part in initiatives such as these can open new doors for networking opportunities which could lead to potential career paths or further educational pursuits within a field that previously may not have been considered by an individual person before participating in their project-related activities. Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of community service is how it brings people together from all walks of life with diverse backgrounds and beliefs working towards achieving common goals. By experiencing this unique form of unity first hand, participants learn just how powerful collaboration amongst different individuals with varying life experiences truly is – especially when everyone is pursuing a cause worth fighting for like improving access to healthcare resources or promoting literacy among lower-income families within their neighborhood . In addition , being involved in volunteer activities allows for local residents to engage directly with members from other neighborhoods which fosters greater political awareness between groups who would otherwise remain unaware due current socioeconomic inequalities present throughout many major urban areas across the nation today .

"Have you ever asked a friend or family member an important question? Have they ever given you an answer that gave you a far from ideal output? Nobody is always right, and many are far from being so. When you need advice on a subject, asking more than one person is always beneficial, because nobody is always correct, and it helps play to the human nature of skepticism and truth-seeking.

Firstly, one must get advice from more than one person because it helps to weed out the truth. In ancient times, people used to think that the earth was flat, and that the sun orbited the earth. This was, of course, inherently wrong, and eventually disproven by astronomers. But we would still believe those things today, if everybody blindly followed other's advice. Instead, these astronomers pushed through the cries of heresy to find the truth. They were skeptics. Speculation and skepticism breed creativity and the need for truth, two essential facets of human existance. You may think that this is getting a bit off-topic, but it actually mirrors the topic at hand. We must be skeptical of others advice, for taking bad advice can be extremely detrimental. And what better way to find the truth than to find a collection of them, and pull from that the correct thing to do? A person should get advice from different people, because it plays to the natural human trait of skepticism, which has long been found to be the pathway to truth. But this isnt the only reason one should gather the advice of more than one person.

In the times of the Oregon trail, there was a family that wanted to go west, to find new land to settle on. Most people at the time would go on the Oregon trail, a mapped trail to get to the west. But a family friend told them that he knew a guide who had a much better, easier route. The guide took them about halfway through this 'route', and then informed them that he would have to head back, as he had more groups to take. Shortly thereafter, the trail became much harder. They had to abandon their horse and wagon, and eventually, winter caught up with them. Stuck in a cabin they had found, with no food or water, the family perished. This is only a heavily abridged version of the true story, as the full tale is much more gruesome. The moral, perhaps, is that even people you trust can give you bad, if well-meaning, advice. It is doubted that the family friend even knew how unrepputable the guide was, but he still gave them the advice that eventually led to their deaths. Sometimes, people think that they give good advice, but unbenownst to them, the advice isn't so good at all. If the family had asked more people, they might have lived through that fatal winter.

To recap, to get the best opinion on something, one must ask multiple people, as a single person may be wrong. if you are given multiple possible solutions, then you can find the best one and go with it. The author implores you, next time you are having a tough time making a decision, to ask multiple people, to do research on the solutions given, and to not die in a cabin in the dead of winter.",1,ae2bb3d40ad24859a99d258d6a4655dd
"When it comes to the environment, green energy is becoming increasingly important. As conventional sources of fuel become more expensive and their environmental impacts become damaging, renewable energy sources are gaining traction as an economic and sustainable solution. Solar power specifically is a rapidly growing industry that shows no signs of slowing down in the near future. The use of solar energy offers a variety of advantages: it’s clean, with minimal emissions; its cost-effective, without requiring any burning of fossil fuels; and it’s abundant and freely available from our sun's rays - making it one of the most reliable renewable resources for powering homes, businesses, cities and even countries across the world. In addition to these benefits for consumers looking to lower their bills or reduce their carbon footprint, solar also provides jobs in research & development (R&D), manufacturing and installation which can often pay higher than average wages while enabling communities to benefit from energy independence. It’s clear there are many benefits associated with using solar power but what makes this technology so effective? The key lies in photovoltaic (PV) cells—components that generate electrical current when exposed to light—which convert sunlight into usable electricity at high efficiency rates regardless if cloudy days or night time conditions exist outside. PV panels come in all shapes & sizes too which means they can be easily incorporated into existing buildings or designed in new construction projects allowing flexibility depending on specific needs or demands. As we continue searching for ways to become more self-sufficient while improving our planet's health, investing in solar technology is quickly becoming one step towards achieving both aims simultaneously due its low impact nature yet undeniable effectiveness as an alternative source of electricity production. This influx of interest has consequently driven prices downward coupled with government incentives such as tax credits further encouraging adoption rates causing rapid growth within the industry overall thus helping promote sustainability goals on a global scale like never before seen!

"Dear Senator,

I believe that we should keep Electoral Colleges but massive changes to the system.  These changes would help prevent ties, avoid a large number of ""swing"" state, and also make elections easier.  For one to prevent ties, that is a hard thing to prevent cosidering we have no control over who someone votes for but it can be solved. If, in case of a tie, we due a tie braker as you will.  There will be a revotation process with 499 voters, these voters are picked at random in the city data base.  ""...for example, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him.""

It takes a long time to vote for you and could be faster.  Although the electoral system is slightly flawed we still need to keep the ""peoples"" president, and there are not manyn other ways to do this than to due the system we have now.  The only major problem is the the system is out of date.",1,4a19a0aa6f2e49c79da8c43659e7c2bb
"Seeking multiple opinions when making an important decision or choice can be very helpful for a few key reasons:

Different perspectives bring new insights. When we ask just one person for advice, we get a limited perspective based on that individual's experiences and point of view. However, life experiences vary greatly between people. By seeking opinions from several trusted sources, we gain access to a more well-rounded set of insights and perspectives on the issue at hand. Different people might focus on various important factors, positives or negatives that others may not have considered. This helps us make a more informed choice. 

Balanced recommendations. Individuals can sometimes be biased based on their personal relationships, preferences, or agendas. While well-meaning, a friend may provide advice that is skewed in our favor and misses some important downsides or objective trade-offs. Multiple advisors help ensure a more impartial analysis. They can point out considerations that balance each other out. If different people highlight similar important concerns, risks or recommendations, we can feel more confident about those factors in our decision making. 

Avoiding errors in judgment. No one is immune to erring in their evaluation or being ill-informed on some aspects tied to the choice. Consult just one advisor and their judgment could potentially include some misperceptions or gaps. However, if several independent advisors highlight similar counsel after applying their unique lenses, it reduces the chance of being misguided by any one individual's limitations or flaws in reasoning. The collective input of even just a few additional opinions helps safeguard against making a misinformed choice due to any single source of advice.

In summary, the diversity of perspectives, balanced impartiality, and cross-validation gained from seeking multiple opinions provide a much stronger foundation for decision making compared to relying on a lone advisor. This approach helps make well-informed choices that consider more complete pictures, reduce individual limitations and avoid potential pitfalls.",0,8c9f2b180a7e45afb6f322df97017050
"I believe that children should be taught to cooperate, as it is the most beneficial way to live. Cooperation allows for a more efficient and effective society, as it leads to a greater degree of cooperation and communication. Cooperation also allows for a more equitable distribution of resources, as everyone benefits from working together.

One of the best ways to teach children to cooperate is through competition. However, competition should only be used as a tool to motivate children and to ensure that they are working hard. Too often, competition becomes a way to judge children and to put them down. This is not only harmful to the children involved, but it also has negative consequences for society as a whole.

One of the most harmful consequences of competition is that it can lead to a sense of entitlement. Children who are taught to compete often believe that they are entitled to win, and they become unwilling to cooperate. This can have a negative impact on their academic performance and their social lives.

In addition, competition can lead to a sense of rivalry. Children who are taught to compete often become competitive with one another, which can lead to conflict and animosity. This can have a negative impact on their relationships with their peers and their family members.

Finally, competition can lead to a sense of entitlement and a lack of empathy. Children who are taught to compete often become self-centred and insensitive to the feelings of others. This can have a negative impact on their social and emotional development.

Therefore, I believe that children should be taught to cooperate, rather than to compete. This is the most beneficial way to live, as it leads to a greater degree of cooperation and communication, a more equitable distribution of resources, and a better social and emotional development.

"]

Dear Senator [Senator's last name],

I am writing this letter to express my support for the Electoral College system as the method for selecting the President of the United States. While there has been recent debate on whether to abolish it and move towards a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has important advantages that should be considered.

First and foremost, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This minimizes the potential for disputes and uncertainties over the results, as we have seen in the past. In fact, the likelihood of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is highly unlikely, given the total number of electoral votes being an even number.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President is the choice of a diverse range of voters with trans-regional appeal. This is important because it prevents candidates from solely focusing on specific regions and disregarding the interests of others. As Judge Posner mentions, a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful President, as residents of other regions may feel disenfranchised. It is crucial that the President represents and considers the interests of all citizens.

Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in the Electoral College leads to a focus on swing states during campaigns. As mentioned by Judge Posner, this ensures that voters in swing states pay closer attention to the campaign and are more likely to be well-informed and thoughtful in their decision-making. By having swing states play a significant role in determining the outcome of the election, we prioritize the voice of these voters and give them more influence over the final result.

Moreover, the Electoral College also helps to balance the power between large and small states. This is necessary due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate as stated in the Constitution. Without the Electoral College, candidates would heavily prioritize campaign efforts towards more populated states, leaving smaller states with less attention and influence. The Electoral College system helps to ensure that large and small states receive a fair level of attention during the campaign period.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the complications of run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. By invariably producing a clear winner, the Electoral College simplifies the presidential election process and ensures that the outcome is decisive.

I understand that some critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their votes may have no effect. However, it is essential to note that voters in presidential elections generally want to express a political preference rather than thinking that their single vote will decide the election outcome. Despite this, a significant portion of the eligible American population still votes, as observed in the 2012 election.

In conclusion, the Electoral College brings important benefits to our system of electing the President. It provides certainty of outcome, ensures trans-regional appeal, focuses on swing states, balances power between large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While the system may have its flaws, it is crucial that we carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages before making any significant changes. I believe that the Electoral College is fundamental in maintaining a fair and balanced approach to electing the President of the United States.

Thank you for your time and consideration of my viewpoint. I trust that you will take these arguments into account when making decisions regarding the Electoral College. If you have any further questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

"Dear State Senator, The Electoral College is unfair for voters all around the United States. The Electoral College is a Winnertakeall system in each state, the candidates don't spend time in the states that they know they have no chance of winning. They only focus on the tight races in the swing states. For example during the campaign in 2000, seventeen states did not see the candidates at all. Voters in the twenteyfive of the largest media markets didn't even get to see a single campaign ad!

Further more, ""voters vote for not the president, but a slate of electorss, who in turn elect the president."" Voters cant always control who their electorss vote for. The voters sometimes even get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. If you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for Bob Smith just an example, you'd vote for a slate of thirtyfour Democratic electorss who are pledged to Bob Smith. If those electorss won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Bob would get 34 electorsal votes toward his presidency. The electorss can be anyone not holding a public office.

Did you know that over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election more tham the kind of election we have now. According to the article "" a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after AI Gprethanks to the quirks of the electorsal collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO, in their time, all agreed on one thing, abolishing the Electoral College. This years voters can and will expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency, once again.

The best argument against the electorsal college is called the disaster factor. Americans should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, but the system allows for worse. "" Consider that the state legislature are technically responsible for picking electorss, and that those electorss, and that those electorss could always defy the will of the people."" In 1960, segregationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electorss with brand new electors who would go against John F. Kennedy. Some faithless electorss have even refused to vote for their party's candidate and instead they vote for whoever they want.

So its official now, the Electoral College is outdated, unfair, and irrational. The name makes no sense also why is it called the Electoral ""College""? The Electoral College should just be abolished like Bob Dole said.",1,e8d34e3709514d989a5de966217f879f
"Phones & Driving

The use of cellular phones has spread like wildfire in the last ten years. It has become a part of everyday life for many American citizens, and a good number of people depend on them to carry out daily operations. Unfortunately, many of these daily operations occur while the individual is driving. As a result, many accidents have taken place in the last ten years due to the use of cellular phones while on the road.

This leads me to believe that if people can't concentrate on the road while talking on a cell phone, they shouldn't talk at all while driving. Rather than restricting access, the goal should be to provide in-vehicle information systems and safer means of using your cellular phone while driving. I understand that restricting cell phone usage while driving altogether isn't the best means for solving the problem.

I do, however, believe that more safety precautions need to be taken for individuals who will be talking on their phones while driving. Phones are being created by Erricson, Motorolla, and Nokia today in which offer a hands-free cell phone so that you can keep both hands on the wheel while driving and talking. Some of these come in the form of headsets and give the user a voice-activated sequence, which allows you to talk into the speaker, and the number will instantly be dialed. Already this has eliminated the chance of your hands being off the wheel and having to do the act of dialing the phone. Both which allow you to keep your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.

Even hands-free devices that allow us to talk on the phone while driving with both hands on the wheel are still a hazard. Studies have shown that while talking to someone on the phone your brain is putting a lot of its energy into the conversation. This means that less of your brain is focused on driving the car. Yes, that could also mean a conversation with someone in the car is dangerous but you add in bad reception, how uncomfortable the hands-free earpieces are to wear and the annoyance of static or wind and you have a worse distraction.

Whatever it is can almost always wait until you get where you are going. If it can't wait, you can always stop to look. Cell phone use should be banned for the safety of everyone on the roads. It may not be as convenient, but we won't lose nearly as many teenage lives to Tweets or texts if they know their license could be taken if they do look.",1,4c4112665164439fb1d8c38eebfb9e7b
"
Failure can be an intimidating concept for many, yet it is essential to our growth as people. We must acknowledge that it is part and parcel of life, and that it can be used to become a successful person. It is a key factor that should be embraced as a means of learning from our mistakes and focussing on our development. Despite this, there are still those who maintain that it should be avoided at all costs. 

From my own experience, failure has been a key contributor to my success as a person. As a student, it was only upon getting a failing grade on an assignment that I understood the importance of studying thoroughly and engaging deeply with every learning module. This, in turn, gave me the motivation to ensure that I take responsibility for my actions and perform to a higher level. In this sense, failure had provided me the extra push to strive towards bettering myself. 

However, there are still those who feel that failure should be shied away from, in order to maintain a feeling of invincibility. It can be difficult to come to terms with failure, since it often serves as a reminder of our own personal shortcomings. Yet, it is only through embracing failure that we can truly grow and become better versions of ourselves. 

In the end, it is up to each of us to determine how we confront failure and learn from it. Whether it is seen as an opportunity for growth or a sign of defeat is ultimately in our hands. We should recognize the fact that failure is an essential part of life, and that it can be used to become successful. Only then is it possible to tap into our potential and strive for greater heights in our lives.",0,3ab45ee358574e859e1a60b471e97053
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This has been observed in various countries around the world, as highlighted in the passages provided. By implementing measures to reduce car dependency, communities can achieve numerous benefits such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, increased accessibility to public transportation, and enhanced quality of life.

One of the greatest advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of these emissions, both in Europe and the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, communities can make strides in combating climate change and improving the overall health of the environment.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also lead to improved air quality. The passage about Paris enforcing a driving ban due to smog illustrates how car emissions can contribute to poor air quality. By restricting car usage, communities can mitigate the impact of air pollution and create a healthier living environment for their residents.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can encourage the development of more compact and accessible communities. As described in the passage about Vauban, Germany, smart planning can involve placing stores within walking distance and prioritizing public transportation over private cars. This approach not only reduces the need for car usage but also fosters a sense of community and promotes a healthier lifestyle.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for increased accessibility to public transportation. The passage about Bogota, Colombia, highlights how a car-free day can encourage alternative forms of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit. By promoting these modes of transportation, communities can reduce congestion on the roads and make public transportation a more viable and convenient option for residents.

Finally, limiting car usage can contribute to an overall improved quality of life. The passage about Vauban, Germany, emphasizes how residents who have given up their cars feel happier and less stressed. This is supported by the passage about the decline in car ownership in the United States, which suggests that Americans are finding alternative ways to meet their transportation needs. By reducing car dependency, individuals can experience a greater sense of freedom and flexibility in their daily lives.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals and society as a whole. It can lead to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, increased accessibility to public transportation, and an overall improved quality of life. By adopting measures to reduce car dependency, communities can contribute to a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly future.",0,e25c9290989d4b7cacdec81bbd2ea492
"The electorian collage is a very popular thing amonst states and well some states have a just one law for it others are a lot more strict on there laws one of the ways they can win is by a winner take all vote but the other way is by a more popular vote where the people can vote and then the winners of the voting will vote agenst eachother and thoes two states are nebraska and maine

So what is the electorial collage you might ask well what happends is voters vote not for the president but for a state of electors who in turn elect the president if you lived in texas and voted for john kerry you vote for a state of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry. on the off chance that thoes electors won the statewide electon they would get 34 electoral votes and kerry would get 34 electoral votes.",1,05277876b4f34e8a929a135d7ad1351b
"Some advantages on limiting car use can be actually very favorable for the enviroment as well as for the people. If the usage of car is limited there would be less pollution, less car accidents and no more ""stuck in traffic"". As of that it would be a healthy way of life, more excise and more time to pass with other people.

One thing that could be a good way to start this ""Limited Car Usage"" would be what the city of Bogota, Colombia is doing: The Day Without Cars. This is promoted as a program when in that day cars are banned with only buses and taxis permited. This inspires the people to walk more, ride a bike, and if something is very, very far they could just take a bus or a taxi. This would make a great impact on people's life and maybe it would soon be joined by other cities or whole countries like the cities of Cali and Valledupar have already done.

In Paris, France driving was banned due to smog, not exactly like that, but it was partially banned to clear the air of the city. For example one rule they had was that on monday motorists with even-numbered licence plates were ordered to leave their cars at home and that they next day it would be the odd-numbered plates who would have to follow this rule. Thanks to this little rule congestion was down 60 percent in France's capital and the smog was cleared off.

In America is almost the End of Car Culture. There have been recent studies that suggests that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. By this alone you can see that ""We are witnessing a long-term cultural shift"" as Mimi Sheller said. Now yes, this whole ""No Car"" or ""Car Limiting"" rules can have a negative implication for the car industries, but in general for the rest of the people this would be a good impact in their lives.

In general ""Car Limiting"" can only make a positive impact in the lives of most of us and also in the enviroment. And as Bill Ford said at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelora, Spain: ""Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety"".",1,ccded302ee74472288a36e3a0605e50c
"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly clear, as demonstrated by examples from around the world. Vauban, a suburb in Germany, has implemented a car-free policy, with only two places available for car parking. As a result, 70% of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57% of residents sold their cars when they moved there. The residents of Vauban have found that giving up their cars has led to a decrease in stress and an overall increase in happiness. This trend is not limited to Germany; it is growing in Europe, the United States, and other parts of the world.

Limiting car usage is an essential step towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By separating suburban life from the use of cars, communities like Vauban are able to drastically reduce emissions from tailpipes. This approach is known as ""smart planning"" and involves making suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, as well as reducing the space available for parking. By placing stores within walking distance on a main street, instead of in malls along highways, communities can encourage residents to rely less on cars for their everyday needs.

Efforts to limit car usage are gaining traction in the United States as well. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are beginning to take action. It is expected that public transportation serving suburbs will play a much larger role in federal transportation bills in the coming years. In the past, the majority of funding has gone towards highways, but that is likely to change as the importance of reducing car usage becomes more widely recognized.

Other cities around the world are also implementing car-free initiatives. Paris recently enforced a partial driving ban to combat smog, and the ban led to a 60% decrease in congestion. Bogota, Colombia has been hosting a car-free day for the past few years, which has gained popularity and drawn the attention of municipal authorities from other countries. These cities are discovering that limiting car usage not only improves air quality but also promotes alternative transportation options, reduces stress, and creates a more connected and vibrant community.

The decrease in driving and car ownership in the United States may indicate a fundamental shift in American behavior. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This trend could have significant implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is one of the largest sources of emissions in the country. While the decrease in driving can partly be attributed to the recession, researchers believe that there is something more fundamental going on. Factors such as the rise of telecommuting, the renewal of center cities, and the availability of car-pooling apps are all contributing to a cultural shift away from car dependence.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and impactful. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions to improving air quality and reducing stress, communities around the world are finding that embracing alternative transportation options and creating car-free spaces can lead to significant benefits. By reimagining suburbs and promoting the use of public transportation, walking, and biking, we can create more sustainable and vibrant communities for future generations.",0,577902c283c14630b84287374b278634
"I would agree and disagree at the same time because their can be good reason and bad reason of why it good to extend 2 hours of school and working for 10 hours each day. My first reason is that it good extending the 2 hours helps you learn more things and catch up with any work. What is good about Working for 10 hours each day is that you will have money for colloge and save up. What is bad for working 10 hours is that you will be tired and sleepy.

For example if you work four-day week you should work at least for 8 hours only because you need to get enought sleep, leave some time for home work. But it also can be good because you can only work for four-days and rest the week days. Working more than 8 hours you will feel tired,sleepy and frustrated. Therefore it better to work only 8 hours instead of 10 hours because it too much,as a result you can get bad consequence or bad grades.

My other reason is that I think school should not follow this model because working each day 10 hours it too much. However their can be bad consequence of working 10 hours and extendidng

2 hours in school. My first reason is that you can be tired and not listining to the teacher while she teaching. Second reason is that if you extend the hours of school many student will be livid for staying more hours in school.

I think that the school should not extend the hours is because some teachers need to be in places too,needs to rest and also needs more time on grading papers. I also think that many students have part time jobs and also they need to be somewhere. Some students will be tired and sleepy. Another reason I have is that student needs to go home early to go do their homework,rest alittle.    ",1,91c36bf179f14cb2b31e99b76451c905

Asking For Advise

What is something you are good at? This answer varies for different people based on a couple of different things. When asking for advice, we ask more that one person because different people are good at different things based on their experiences and opinions. When we are uncertain about something and we get feedback from other people, we will feel more confident in that decision.

Everyone has had a different life, some are similar, but none are the same. Since everyone has had a different life, different people have different experiences. For example, someone named Generic_Name might go to a store on Monday, and have a terrible experience there because they did not have what he was looking for. Someone else named get could go to that same store, on the same day, and have a great experience just because she was looking for something else. She and Generic_Name would be looking for different items based on the different lives they live. If another person named Generic_Name wanted to know which store to go to, she might ask both Generic_Name and Generic_Name. However, since they both had such different experiences, Generic_Name might want to know a third person's experience. She might ask another person whether or not she should go to this store, and based on what their experience was, they might tip the scales in one direction or another. The differences in our lives are based on the way that we live our lives.

Everyone has a different opinion. There are opinions about whether or not someone believes in something, opinions about someone is doing the right thing, opinions about what the right thing is, and many, many more. This is why, when people are looking for advise, they go to more than one person. They want to get as much feedback as possible because they think they are giving themselves the best resources to succeed.

Many people lack confidence in their decisions. However, there is a solution that can help them more every time they do it. The more people that you have to back up your decision, the more confident you feel about it. If someone is not feeling confident in their decision, when another person comes and tells them that it is the right decision, they feel more confident about it. In order to feel confident in their choices, a person needs support.

People want to know how to make the best decision and the way that they do that is by asking for advice. When someone is unsure about whether or not their choice is the right one and they ask another person, that person is boosting their confidence. The reason that people ask more than one person for advice, is so that they can be confident in their choice, have a variety of opinions, and know what other people have experienced.",1,6306c8008da541a0a5c2b5c9d034fa62
"Likewise, many people belive that "" Determine never to be idle ... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". By all means that by being idle you wont get much done, but if active can get a lot of more stuff done. Others belive that by being idle, you can still get anything done as much as a person that is consistently active. I strongly agree that by being active will get more tasks complete and it will be less difficult. By always having something to do, your showing everyone your character and your morals. Inactivity and idleness is not good because by not having anything to do you wont learn as much as a person that has to do majority of time. Actively participator have better improved skills then those who dont do anything.

Firstly, being active is the best goal a mind set can have. It will be less likely for one to not complete a task or struggle with a task if is idle. Always doing something no matter if you have nothing to do, shows a lot about someones motivation and actions. Especially in a work place, if your boss sees you doing nothing while there being things to do, hes going to think your inactive. By showing everyone you always have something to do, your showing them that you are capable of doing anything. Theres no task to difficult or no job to big for you to complete because you are already used of always doing something in your everyday life and while being idle from the task isnt part of your expectation or motives. If you think of always being occupied and being successful it practically the same concept just because getting task done is like you doing anything you are asked to do and being successful is like achieving your goals.

Secondly, Idle and inactivity serves a purpose when you are a 100 percent sure you can do anything when asked to. For example my dad once told me, why are you always playing video games and that why dont i go and play outside with my friends. What i told him was that i did not want to and he told me that my actions show a lot about who i am. After that he signed me up for a youth soccer team, that i played being a defender. Although i wasnt good, i started trying my best and being active with the team. Later that day my coach was talking to my dad and telling him how i was participating and doing everything he told me to do. What he also had suggested to my dad was if he can move me up to a left forward because of all the hard work and commitment i had done for the pass warm ups and practice games.

Therefore, people that are always participating you will see improvement in grades, work ethic and body structure. People that always are doing something productive in there everyday life have good grades because they are used of finishing all their work, rather then the student that doesnt do anything and idled from the class. Humans that are always active rather than being idle and isolated have a better attitude and work experience. Going to the Gym doesnt only show that you have an excellent daily routine but you are person that has a goal to complete each and every day. Keeping your self occupied thew out any circumstance is a good skill and shows that you are not inactive and that nothing is excluding you from doing anything you have to do.

In conclusion, do you think always having something to do all the time shows who you really are? Participating shows a lot about a person goals and achievements. Inactive people show their lack of interest and the type of attitude shown. While a person that is consistently doing things and keeping there self occupied and does not tend to complain about what they are ever asked to do. Always doing stuff will make you want to complete more each and every time.",1,156f8acd008644349db1292397e2dd5e
"Education is a vital component in everyone's life, and it is often considered as the backbone of a successful career. Many people believe that education is a life-long process, while others do not agree. In my opinion, education is indeed a life-long process, and I strongly support this statement. There are several reasons why I believe that education is an ongoing process, and I will discuss them in the following paragraphs.

Firstly, the world is changing rapidly, and new technologies and ideas are emerging every day. As a result, individuals need to keep themselves updated with the latest information and knowledge to stay relevant in their respective fields. Continuous learning can help individuals to adapt to new situations and challenges, and it can also enhance their problem-solving skills. For instance, a doctor who keeps himself updated with the latest medical advancements can provide better treatment to his patients and save more lives.

Secondly, education is not only about acquiring knowledge but also about developing skills and attitudes. Learning new skills can help individuals to become more efficient and productive in their professional and personal lives. For example, a person who learns a new language can communicate with people from different cultures and countries, which can help him to expand his business or career opportunities. Similarly, developing a positive attitude towards learning can help individuals to become more motivated and confident in their abilities.

Lastly, education is not limited to formal institutions such as schools and colleges. It can happen anywhere, anytime, and in any form. Individuals can learn through various means, such as reading books, attending seminars and workshops, watching online tutorials, and interacting with experts in their respective fields. The availability of online courses and e-learning platforms has made education more accessible and affordable for everyone.

In conclusion, education is a life-long process that plays a crucial role in shaping individuals' lives. It is not just about acquiring knowledge but also about developing skills and attitudes that can help individuals to succeed in their personal and professional lives. Therefore, I strongly believe that everyone should embrace continuous learning and strive to improve their knowledge and skills throughout their lives.

"I agree with the author suggests that studying is Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents becasue first reason it is a good thing to study about a different planet, second in the past nobody know that Venus is a planet, third it might be danger, but it is something that we should be studying about.

First reason it is a good things to study about a different planet because if we all just studying about Earth it will be getting boring, and we won't know anything about the other planet. According to the text "" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size."" When I read this quote I was already excited to learn about Venus. As we study something different the more we are become smart.

Secodn reason, in the past nobody know that Venus is a planet because they thought Venus was one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. According to the text "" Venus, sometimes called the "" Evening Star"". They are having thought about Venus like because they haven't never see Venus or study about the Venus. This is the reason why I agree with the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Third reason, it might be danger, but it is something that we should be studying because the more we learn something new tge more we are getting smart. According to the text it say "" In our solar system, venus is the second planet from our sun"". I knew nobody can't go near the sun because we will be already melt if we go near to the sun. The Venus is the second planet from the sun, and it is danger. Even though we can't go up there and look what it is look like because it is danger, but we should at least study about it at school.

In conclusion, I agree with the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents because it is a good things to study about a different planet, in the past nobody know that Venus is a planet, it might be danger, but it is something that we should be studying about. These three reason are important because in future we can teach our kids about Venus so that they won't be suprised when they found out that Venus is a planet and it is the second planet from the sun.",1,81451d8f769142efab1d064deca2eace
"Dear, state senator

I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the United States.

Because it's easier to read when voting, everything is label right, and the President has alot of trust in people.

First of all, I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the

United States because it's easier to read when voting. In source one, by the Office of the Federal Register, it states that ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President"". This shows that when all the votes are tallyed up theirs no need to go through so much problem, when their's basically a rubric to go over the electors and the electoral votes. For example, if this wasn't invented, we would have our own people just sit their on long day and nights. Without any sleep and count all those votes. This could lead to alot of miscounts. This is why I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the presidnet of the United States.

Furthermore, I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the

United States because everything is label right. In source one, by the Office of the Federal Register, it states that ""Under the 23rd Amendement of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors. . . ."". This shows that whatever the 23rd Amendment is under, that's what the District of Columbia is allocated. This is just like an case at court or when you getting arrested. For example, when you are pleged guilty for murder. The judge is going to read every amendment you broke and what's your charges. And everything that's she's reading is made up. It's all labeled in United State Constitution. This is why i strongly believe we should keep the Electroal College for the president of the United States.

Lastly, I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the

United States because the president has alot of people to trust in. In source one, by the Office of the Federal Register it states that ""Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors."" This shows that whoever the president of the United State is choosing for his or her own group of electors has put alot of trust on each and one of that individual. And it's time for the President to see who or who he can't put his trust in. For example, A president has alot of things that we depend on him or her to do for our Country. And the Electoral College is the best way to see if he or she could do it. This is why I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the United States.

In conclusion, I strongly believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the United States because; One, it's easier to read when voting. If the Electoral College didn't existed their would be alot of miscounting. Second, everything is label right. Their's no need to get things from the top of your head. Third, the presdient has aot of in trust in people. Us humans gets to finally see if we could depend on him. If he choose's the right group of electors. This is why I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the United States.0",1,06daf2393d4e455d91277abba5c98710

"Advertisements are a ubiquitous part of modern society, and they are designed to influence our purchasing decisions. In many cases, advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, using clever marketing techniques and persuasive language to create a sense of desire and urgency in potential buyers. While some advertisements are truthful and accurate, many others are misleading and deceptive, exaggerating the benefits of a product while downplaying it's drawbacks. In this essay, I will argue that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, and I will provide specific reasons and examples to support my position.

Firstly, advertisements often use hyperbole and exaggeration to make products seem more appealing than they really are. For example, a shampoo advertisement might claim that it's product can ""transform your hair from dull to dazzling in just one wash,"" when in reality, the product may only provide a slight improvement in hair texture and appearance. Similarly, a car advertisement might claim that it's vehicle has ""unmatched performance and reliability,"" when in reality, the car may have average performance and reliability compared to other vehicles in it's class. These kinds of exaggerated claims are common in advertisements, and they can create unrealistic expectations in consumers, leading to disappointment and dissatisfaction with the product.

Secondly, advertisements often focus on the positive aspects of a product while downplaying or ignoring it's drawbacks. For example, a fast food advertisement might show images of delicious, juicy burgers and crispy fries, while ignoring the fact that the food is high in calories, fat, and sodium, and can contribute to health problems like obesity and heart disease. Similarly, a beauty product advertisement might show models with flawless skin and perfect features, while ignoring the fact that the product may contain harmful chemicals or have little scientific evidence to support it's claims. By emphasizing only the positive aspects of a product, advertisements can create a false sense of security and trust in consumers, leading them to overlook the potential risks and downsides of the product.

Finally, advertisements often use emotional appeals and psychological tricks to influence our purchasing decisions. For example, a perfume advertisement might use romantic imagery and music to create a sense of desire and longing in viewers, while a car advertisement might use images of freedom and adventure to appeal to our sense of wanderlust and curiosity. By tapping into our emotions and desires, advertisements can create a powerful connection with consumers, making them more likely to buy the product even if it is not actually as good as it'seems.

In conclusion, I believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, using hyperbole, exaggeration, selective information, and emotional appeals to create a false sense of value and desirability. While advertisements can be informative and helpful in some cases, it is important for consumers to be aware of the ways in which they can be misleading and deceptive, and to approach them with a critical and skeptical mindset. By doing so, we can make more informed and rational purchasing decisions, and avoid the disappointment and regret that often comes with buying a product that doesn't live up to it's hype.

"I think using the technology Facial Coding System won't work trying to find out how a person is feeling because how could you know what a person is feeling unless you ask them, now I know that a person might be able to tell how your feeling by looking at you, but now we don't use technology to tell how a person's feeling we just look at their facial expressions to tell if their happy, sad, mad, frustrated, or any emotion that their feeling I think we can only tell by looking at their facial expression, they said that by looking at the painting of Mona Lisa that they could tell that she was feeling 83 percent happy, 9 percent, disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 perent angry, now you would never know if she's happy, fearful, disgusted, or angry unless you were with her at that time of the picture you would never know how she's feeling. Thats probably how she takes all of her pictures you never know, she could have been feeling sad, mad, fearful, or anything unless you were with her at that time of the painting andd she told you how she was feeling.

Gaining success in life is an attainable reality with hard work and clear goals. Motivation and dedication are key in order to achieve great things. This can be seen in the many examples of individuals who have accomplished extraordinary things through determination and perseverance. People like Mahatma Gandhi, who led a successful nonviolent resistance against British colonial forces to achieve India's independence, and Bill Gates, who built Microsoft into one of the world's most successful companies, are examples of those who have attained remarkable success. 

At the heart of these accomplishments is an inspirational drive to succeed. It is undeniable that having a supportive family and a community of friends can help an individual achieve their goals as well. It is often said that no one reaches the peak of success alone. Having a supportive network to provide comfort and encouragement can give the extra push needed to reach lofty heights. 

In general, it is possible to accomplish great things in life with hard work, clear objectives, and the help of family and friends. Those who have done so are living proof that hard work and determination can pay off and lead to remarkable success.",0,79ff4dfc7f984d1ca0e7439dafcc7bbd

This summer, I had the privilege of visiting a small village in South America. Although I had the opportunity to engage in a variety of activities while there, one of the most memorable experiences was learning how to make traditional pottery. I was amazed to discover how much time, hard work and patience goes into making just one pot. I was equally astonished by the intricate designs the potters were able to create. 

The process, which involved mixing clay with water and collecting materials from the local environment, taught me the value of craftsmanship and taking pride in one’s work. It also showed me that even with so few resources, one can still create something of beauty. Observing the dedication of the potters in the village and the joy in their faces when they were able to produce a successful pot, taught me that there is pleasure in working carefully and patiently and that you don’t have to be wealthy to be content. This experience has certainly changed me and I hope to take this lesson with me wherever life takes me.",0,ca1e4ecc0274490dbac89c15f187f317
"The use of public transportation has been a major part of urban life for many centuries. However, in recent years the trend has shifted away from utilizing this form of transport due to various factors such as increasing pollution levels and rising fares. Despite these challenges, it is still highly beneficial for commuters to take advantage of public transportation systems. This essay will discuss three main reasons why people should make use of public transportation when travelling within cities - convenience, cost savings, and ecological benefits. First and foremost, taking a bus or train to get around a city can be incredibly convenient compared to depending solely on cars. Most public transit networks are built around dense areas with frequent stops which allows passengers to quickly travel from one destination to another without having the need for parking or dealing with heavy traffic jams. It also offers flexibility in terms of route planning since multiple routes are available at any given time which makes it easier for travellers who have limited mobility options like seniors or those with disabilities. Furthermore modern forms of digital payment options – such as mobile apps – have made boarding vehicles even simpler by electronically tracking tickets so there’s no need wait in line just purchase them anymore before getting into the vehicle itself!. In addition using public transit frequently saves money over time because fares tend lower than their private car counterparts when factoring in costs like maintenance fuel gasoline insurance etc On top all that mass transit often provides discounts students senior citizens military personnel disability pass-holders plus other categories That reason alone promotes more sustainable lifestyles by encouraging individuals focus their attention towards less expensive alternative while avoiding expensive short-term solutions. . Finally riding buses trains streetcars subways etc help protect environment both directly indirectly Since they run electrically powered engines emit far fewer pollutants into air compared automobiles This not only decreases amount smog haze created but reduces overall noise pollution as well greenhouses gases produced through burning fuels potential danger global warming too Thus investing better infrastructure for everyone would ultimately lead healthier planet future generations reap rewards. Overall there numerous advantages

"The effects of greenhouse gas emission began to take their toll on the earth's atmosphere simply by its own natural output. As time has gone on though, and humans and their ways of transportation have evolved, greenhouse gas emission is becoming more of a problem. Automobiles, mainly cars, play a huge role in the production of nasty fumes and gases that become trapped in the atmosphere. For example, in Europe passenger cars make up twelve percent of total greenhouse gas emission, and in heavily congested areas such as the United Statesit can skyrocket up to fifty percent!

Some nationscountries are beginning to take a new approach to battle the ""War of Greenhouse Gases"". As studies have shown that national driving levels and the amount of people purchasing cars and earning their licenses are dropping after their peak in 2005, people are more and more willing to put down the car keys and put on their running shoes. One of these places in particular is the city of Vauban and is located in Germany. It is a middleclass to upper class community and its citizens can be considered pioneers of suburbia. Vauban does not permit driving in it's limits, besides the main thoroughfare, and a few side streets. Car owners buy a space for their car for 40,000 alongside a home.

While some might argue about the practicality of not driving your car if you have one, it's shown to be extremely beneficial not only for the environment, but for people as well. When you go outside, whether you're headed somewhere or just on a casual stroll, you may reach Nirvana as you enjoy the true sounds of nature. In places where cars are permitted to drive, you might hear the sound of birds chirping outside your window, or the calm rustle of leaves rustling in the wind, but the rumbles, roars, and honks of a car are not far behind. In areas such as Vauban, the beautiful sounds of the world won't be drowned out by a greasy hunk of steel.

Besides feeling at peace, a life without a car is a healthier life! Now, when you want to go somewhere, you must rely on your own two feet. Those two feet, bicycle, skateboard, etc. will be all you need to get where you're going! Unlike many places though, everything is within walking distance for convenience and to encourage you to take these steps. Notice the physical and emotional changes in yourself once in a place with no carsyou'll feel more relaxed, less rushed, and your body will thank you.",1,f566bc3a41414b798f056ecddfc64b1c
"Dear state senator,

I belive  we should change the way for election .Under the electoral colloge system voters vote  for a state of electors who turn elect the president, and that not right .

"The use of technology in the classroom has revolutionized the way students learn. While many teachers have embraced this shift, there are still those who have reservations about its effectiveness and utility. But whether one loves it or hates it, there is no denying that technology has become an integral part of today’s classrooms. When used correctly, technology can be a powerful tool for student learning. It makes instruction more engaging and allows students to take ownership of their education. Students can actively participate in lessons with interactive whiteboards, online simulations, virtual labs and collaborative activities like group discussions boards or video conferencing. They’re also able to extend their knowledge by researching topics using computers and other digital information sources like databases and websites designed specifically for educational purposes. Classroom teachers often find that incorporating technology into instruction helps them reach out to all types of learners—those who learn best through text-based material as well as those who respond better when visual aids such as presentations are included in lessons. Technology also gives teachers an opportunity to assess student understanding much quicker than traditional paper-and-pencil exams might allow them too; they’re able give feedback almost immediately after assessing each individual response from their class via eActivities or quizzes administered on computer software programs like NearPod or Kahoot!. This also frees up additional time for further exploration with more involved projects geared toward helping students develop critical thinking skills rather than just surface level memorization of facts, figures and dates associated with class material that may not stick after exams end but will help prepare them for real world applications later on down the line should they pursue a career related to what was learned within the coursework itself. In conclusion, while some educators may struggle adapting current teaching methods to include modern technological advances while others thrive at moving forward into tech-enabled curriculums; either way it's clear that use of said technologies within lesson plans offer tremendous benefits both inside & outside the classroom

"When people ask for advice the tinned to ask more then one person. It can help make a better choice as to just going of your gut feeling sometime. They could just follow throw with there gut feeling and just date or get a dovoire on some one. So when in a life crises it can get a little wild like you start buy stuff and more and more. So i would go to at lest two therapist and ask for help

It helps to talk to more people for advise it helps make a better opinion the just winging it and going with the flow. Imagine just going to SPCA and the fist dog you see you get it like you dont even care. No you dont do the you ask you friends and sometime family and the SPCA owner. Heres a other point you just dont buy a car you have to look and talk with other people for the right car brand or like do you need a truck or a SUV or a mini van. It all depends on who you talk with like if you talk with your parents or the Dealer ship guy. Having a baby takes a lot so you will have to talk plan and all that stuff. Here some stuff that you would need to talk to someone about divorce,Margie,loan,baby

But still the gut feeling is not all bad like when you playing baseball and the fly ball comes at you or when your fishing and you feel a little bite on the bait. When your running and you say in your head i can make it that is your gut feeling talking .you just cant be completely idiotic about it that is what i am saying. Just dont pull out a 20,000 dollar loan for a car you want. your going to have to pay it back later it is not fun going poor.

Advice is impotent in life so just dont blow it away for a cool super boat that would just be stupid would int it be.

"In this reading, the author is talking about exploring venus, but all his evidence speaks differently. I believe the author does not support the clam that Venus is a worthy pursuit because the evidence given is mediocre. He contradicts himself in many paragraphs proving why we shouldn't send people over, and has not given any reason why we should go over there.

In this short persuasive article, the author does not pursuade at all. In paragraph two, the backround of Venus is given, but it's not stated why its important to visit this planet. ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size."" The only valid reason givin in this short story is when it is said in paragraph 4, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This statement gives no reason for traveling and researching Venus except for the fact it used to be like Earth.

Though it is said Earth is one of a kind, this article states Venus is the most like Earth planet they've ever found. That could be a valid reason to explore and consider inhabiting, but it is proven with evidence that Venus is inhospitable and would serve no purpose in researching and visiting. In paragraph three, it is said, ""On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" These conditions are said to be inhospitable in paragraph four. It is also said, ""Such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our ocean and liquify."" This evidence says the planet is almost impossible to visit and collect data on, except in the fifth paragraph, it is a very long explanation as to how we could even study venus. This is then contradicted in the sixth paragraph by saying photography and videography are ineffective because of the thick atmosphere, and no samples would be possible because the ground conditions are too bad for humans, and even metal.

In conclusion, the evidence the author has given us condradicts and outweighs the evidence given for the idea Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, meaning he did not support this idea.",1,8e58e6f13a5c448980fa5ebfd6875d5c
"It is often said that young people enjoy life more than their older counterparts, but whether or not this is true ultimately comes down to personal experience. In my opinion, this statement is largely true, as young people often have the luxury of living life with fewer responsibilities and worries, allowing them to explore and savor life more fully.

One primary reason why young people are able to enjoy life more is that they generally have fewer responsibilities. Young people are often still in school, which typically comes with fewer obligations than a job or family. They often don't have as many financial responsibilities, and they may not have to take care of a home or children. This lack of responsibility often translates into a greater freedom to explore and enjoy life. For example, young people may have more time to travel, try new hobbies, and socialize with friends. These experiences can be incredibly enriching and can give young people a greater sense of wonder and appreciation for life.

In addition to having fewer responsibilities, young people often have fewer worries than older people. As people age, they may become increasingly concerned about the future. They may worry about their career prospects, their health, and their financial security. They may also start to feel the weight of their past decisions, and they may become anxious about how to make the most of the time they have left. Young people, on the other hand, are often less concerned with these matters. They may feel more secure in their future, as they can often rely on their parents or other family members to provide support if needed. This lack of worry allows young people to focus more on the present and savor the experiences of life.

Finally, young people often have more energy than older people. This greater energy can translate into a greater capacity for joy and excitement. Young people may have the physical and mental energy to take on new challenges, explore new places, and try new activities. They may also have the energy to stay up late, have fun with friends, and get involved in exciting projects. All of these experiences can create a greater sense of enthusiasm and appreciation for life.

In conclusion, I believe that young people often enjoy life more than older people. This is largely due to the fact that they typically have fewer responsibilities, worries, and more energy. As a result, they often have the opportunity to explore and savor life more fully.

"One of the most important aspects in maintaining a healthy lifestyle is getting enough sleep. While many people think that they can survive on short amounts of sleep, studies have shown that lack of proper sleep can lead to numerous health problems such as depression, obesity, and even heart disease. It is essential for individuals to make sure they get at least seven hours of quality rest per night in order to remain productive and healthy throughout their lives. It may be difficult for some individuals to consistently get an adequate amount of rest due to hectic schedules or other factors beyond their control. However, it is possible with some simple techniques; setting a regular bedtime routine, avoiding consuming caffeine late in the day and limiting screen time before going to bed are all easy ways one can ensure they receive sufficient shut-eye each evening. Additionally, controlling light exposure while sleeping by using blackout curtains or shades helps keep melatonin levels balanced which leads to more deep sleep cycles. Exercising during the day also increases one’s ability to fall asleep faster at night which reduces tossing and turning from being overtired when trying drift off into dreamland. The body releases endorphins after physical activity which helps relax muscles naturally so individuals don’t become too tense when attempting slumbering later on in the evening. Yoga poses such as legs up against wall pose or corpse pose help stretch out tense muscles further aiding in relaxation preparation before laying down for an extended period of time . Getting adequate amounts of restful sleep isn't just beneficial for mental well-being but supports physical healthiness too! One should not take chances with how much time they spend unconscious because better sleeping habits equate with healthier living overall!

"These days, people in growing numbers are beginning to complain that work is more stressful and less leisurely than in past. Is this true?

Yes, it is true that the pace of work has increased, and that people are working longer hours than they used to. But this is not a new phenomenon. In fact, we have known for a long time that there is a link between work and stress. The problem is that we don't talk about it enough. We tend to think of stress as something that only happens at the end of the day, when we get home from work. This is simply not true. Stress can happen at any time, even when you are at your desk. It can come from the demands of your job, or it can be caused by other people or situations in your life. So it's important to know how to deal with stress in a healthy way, so that you can enjoy your work as much as possible.

Does The Electoral College Work?""

Is The Question That remains.

""What's Wrong With the electoral college""?

Electors have refused to vote for their party's candidates and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. ""This is the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster fact"". I Think The Disaster Fact is What Has the Office of the Federal Register questioning the Electoral College. Although, The System Allows For Much Worse.

The Electoral College is widely regarded an anachronism. a non-democratic way of selecting our president.

I Think The Electoral College is Unfair Because of The Winner-take-all system in each state. The Winner-takes-all system is the system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. it's basically a gamble. you come with electors, hope for the best and if your luck is good you leave with a jackpot, but sadly if you dont get the jackpot you lose all.

"I believe that we have developed into a ""throw-away society"" because we are filling up our environment with so many plastic bags and rubbish that we cannot fully dispose of. Plastic bags are not biodegradable, so they end up in our environment and pollute it. For example, when a plastic bag is put in the landfill, it breaks down into tiny pieces and releases toxic chemicals into the air. This is why it is important to recycle plastic bags.

Another reason why we have developed into a ""throw-away society"" is because we are using too many single-use items. For example, we use disposable cups and plates, which are not biodegradable. When we throw them away, they end up in our environment and take up space in landfills. We can also reuse these items, but it takes more time and effort.

Finally, we have developed into a ""throw-away society"" because we are filling up our environment with so many plastic bags and rubbish. This is because we are not using enough reusable bags and containers. For example, we can use cloth bags or containers to store our groceries, instead of using plastic bags. This will not only reduce our use of plastic bags, but it will also help to reduce our environmental impact.

"One of the most important things in life is to practice self-care. In an ever-increasingly chaotic and fast-moving world it can be difficult to take time for yourself, but this is essential in order to maintain a healthy balance between work and leisure activities. Self-care not only helps you keep your stress levels under control, but also allows you time for reflection on what's really important in life. In order to make sure you're taking care of yourself, it's necessary to introduce some form of routine or structure into daily life; even small changes can have a positive impact over time. For instance, setting aside fifteen minutes each morning before doing anything else gives you a chance to clear your head and start the day with intention. During this period, try practicing mindful meditation such as deep breathing exercises or writing down any thoughts that come up during this reflective session will help give clarity and perspective on the tasks ahead for that day. Taking short breaks throughout the day - going for walks outside (socially distanced when necessary!) or simply stretching at your desk are other great ways of staying grounded within yourself and connected with nature's rhythms too!. Engaging in regular physical activity such as yoga is also beneficial – not only does it provide an opportunity for connecting with your body through movement or breathwork, but it’s also been shown to lower cortisol levels helping reduce anxiety and feelings associated with depression too! Exercise doesn't have to involve long runs around town either - simply introducing 10 minutes more into each working day by walking instead of taking public transport can make all the difference when trying build exercise into our hectic schedule. . Finally, limiting access screen times may sound difficult after spending 2020 glued onto our phones/laptops from home however engaging in activities away from screens such as reading books or playing board games can help us reconnect with ourselves without straining our eyes too much!

"The technological advances of the 21st century have revolutionized the way we work, learn, and communicate. While some of these changes have had a largely positive impact on our lives, others are more controversial. This essay will focus on the potential drawbacks of using voice recognition technology for everyday tasks such as web searches, composing emails or messaging friends. Voice recognition software has been around since before the turn of this century, but recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have made it increasingly useful and commonplace today. From virtual assistants like Siri to banking apps that allow customers to check their balance via voice command—it's clear that this technology is here to stay. But while there are many benefits associated with its use—such as convenience and ease-of-use—there are also some serious drawbacks that must be considered when deciding whether or not to utilize it in your daily life. . One major concern about voice recognition technology is privacy invasion. By analyzing individual voices and storing personal data such as search terms or commands spoken aloud, AI can build detailed profiles about users which may be accessed by external parties without permission from those affected by said profile building activities . As a result, many people express concerns over how their private information might be used without their knowledge or consent; fears which could potentially discourage them from embracing new technologies altogether. Moreover, an inability for individuals to understand exactly what data is being collected about them can leave people feeling powerless over their own security settings - further fuelling anxieties regarding inappropriate access of stored information. . Another downside associated with using voice recognition tech relates to accuracy: while most systems boast high levels of accuracy they often struggle with recognizing dialects other than standard American English – making it difficult for certain communities who speak different languages or dialects at home to make full use of digital services designed with native speakers in mind. In addition, AI sometimes fails to interpret certain verbal cues correctly even among native speakers– frequently leading to embarrassing misunderstandings between machines and

"Phones and Driving

Have you ever wondered about the dangers of operating a phone while driving? Should people be able to use a phone while driving a car? Will there be a future of using phone while driving? There is a great percentage of drivers that use their phones while driving a car. With many opportunities to use a phone while stopped at a red light or stuck in traffic, phones have been a danger to many people. Not being able to use a phone while driving a car is true because of distractions and car crashes.

Using a phone while driving a car is very dangerous. Most car crashes are caused by drivers scrolling through social media, taking pictures, looking at navigation, or searching for music (Evans Moore). Edgar Snyder & Associates states that ""There are about 1.6 million car crashes a year just because the driver is using their phone."" Those car crashes that occurred are all because of drivers attempting to use their phones. Our smartphones are a great resource to have and use but are a major risk to our lives if used at a wrong time and place. Phones should be used before starting the car and used after getting to the desired destination. Drivers should not be able to use a phone while operating a car because they are a distraction and causes many car crashes.

In my personal opinion I don't think people should be able to use a cellphone while operating a car. There are many people lives at stake because of reckless drivers. ""According to the report, cell phones caused 26 percent of car accidents in the U.S. in 2014. Text messaging causes 5 percent of crashes (Bey & Associates)"". Using the phone makes the driver's main focus go from driving to what is on the screen. The reckless drivers cause car accidents and that can cause major injuries. Some of those injuries can cause permanent damage while others are small injuries.

I am pretty positive that there would be a future of using phones and driving. Even though there are many laws that say using a phone while operating a car isn't allowed people still do it on a daily. There are many states that have already banned the usage of phones while driving. ""18 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands prohibit all drivers from using hand-held cell phones while driving. All are primary enforcement laws-an officer may cite a driver for using a hand-held cell phone without any other traffic offense taking place (GHSA)."" There are always those who use their phone while driving, but they should be punished for their recklessness.

There would always be a danger to driving and using a phone. The drivers that look at their phones now are already a danger. With the next generation starting to drive there would be an even bigger percentage of accidents. Those who choose to use the phone while driving should suffer the consequences.

"In today's world, the importance of physical fitness can't be stressed enough. It has become increasingly evident that regular exercise and a healthy diet are essential for living a long, productive life. But with so many competing demands on our time these days, it can often be challenging to make sure we're taking proper care of ourselves by engaging in physical activities. Fortunately, just about anyone can find ways to incorporate more movement into their daily lives without investing too much extra time or energy. For instance, one way to do this is by walking or biking whenever possible instead of driving. This not only helps reduce air pollution caused by cars but also gives us an opportunity to get some fresh air and light physical activity while going about our day-to-day tasks like grocery shopping or running errands. Additionally, those who work at a desk job could try standing up and moving around every half hour or so; this would help increase overall energy levels throughout the day while also providing additional opportunities for light exercise. For those looking for something more intense than casual walks around town or standing up from their chair periodically throughout the day, there are plenty of options available as well! Exercise classes such as yoga and pilates offer an excellent full body workout without requiring hours out of your schedule each week; simply dedicating just two sessions per week could make all the difference when it comes to feeling healthier overall.

"Have we seen any form of life on Mars so far? No, that's why it's clearly a natural landform. Plus, how do the aliens know what we look like. They could look completely different from us. It just so happens that the natural landform look's like a face.

Why would the aliens spend their time making a two mile long face anyways? These natural landform's are common in Cydonia, only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoh. It is indeed interesting and cool to think that it was built by aliens, but it wasn't built by aliens. Don't get me wrong, everyone wishes it was made by aliens, but facts are facts.

In 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over the landmark and got a couple photo's that are ten times better than the 1976 photo's. It was confirmed that the landmark wasn't a face it was just the shadow's that made it look like a face. But of course, skeptics thought the alien markings were hidden by haze. ""It's not easy to target Cydonia"" says Garvin. ""In fact, it's hard work.""(Paragraph 9)

Then, on April 8, 2001, four years after the last photo, another couple of photo's were taken. These photo's were way clearer than the photo's from 1998. "" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" Garvin added. "" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This is proof that aliens did not make this landform.

As you can see, there is plenty of edvidence that the two mile head is a natural landform. Their is way more convicing stories about this topic. But I hope that my side of the argument conviced you that the landform wasn't built by aliens.",1,c7e0acc8cdae4fa0b39261adaeed17d2
"Advertising is ubiquitous in modern society, but how accurate are the representations of the products being advertised? In this essay, I will argue that many advertisements are misleading and make products appear to be better than they really are.

The purpose of advertising is to make a product look attractive to potential buyers. To achieve this, advertisers often employ images of perfection and exaggeration. These tactics are used to make products seem more valuable than they are in reality. Take for example a commercial for a facial cream. The commercial may show a woman’s skin improving with the use of the product, but in reality, the cream’s effects will not be as dramatic. Advertisers also use selective framing to hide certain aspects of the product such as it's size, cost, or ingredients and can even use deceptive language to make the product seem more appealing than it is.

Advertisers also often employ persuasive techniques to make their products appear more desirable. For instance, they may use flattery, making consumers feel special and important, or they may use fear-mongering tactics to make people worry about a product’s potential harms and then provide their own solution. They may also employ celebrity endorsements to make a product seem more desirable or trustworthy. In these cases, the advertiser is using tactics that are designed to influence the viewer’s opinion of the product, rather than providing accurate information about it.

In addition, many advertisements fail to provide a full picture of the product. They may overlook potential risks or side effects, or they may neglect to mention certain features of the product that might be relevant to potential buyers. This can lead to consumers making uninformed decisions about products that may not be suitable for them.

Finally, some advertisements may even be fraudulent, making false or exaggerated claims about a product’s features or performance. Such advertising can be dangerous, as consumers may be unaware of the risks associated with the product, or may be misled into buying something that is not what it appears to be.

In conclusion, it is clear that many advertisements make products seem better than they really are. Advertisers often employ persuasive techniques and selective framing to make a product appear more desirable than it is, and fail to provide a complete picture of a product’s features or potential risks. It is important for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to do their own research when considering a product or service.

"The allocation of government funds is a contentious issue, with some people arguing that the government should prioritize spending on medical care and education rather than building theaters and sports stadiums. While I agree that medical care and education are crucial, I believe that investing in theaters and sports stadiums can also have significant benefits for society.

Firstly, building theaters and sports stadiums can create jobs and stimulate economic growth. The construction of these facilities requires a significant amount of labor, which can provide employment opportunities for local residents. Additionally, once the facilities are built, they can attract tourists and generate revenue for local businesses, such as restaurants and hotels. This can have a positive impact on the local economy and improve the standard of living for residents.

Secondly, theaters and sports stadiums can provide opportunities for cultural and social enrichment. Theaters can host plays, concerts, and other performances that expose people to different forms of art and entertainment. This can broaden people's horizons and foster a greater appreciation for the arts. Similarly, sports stadiums can host games and events that bring people together and promote a sense of community. This can help to build social cohesion and strengthen relationships between individuals and groups.

However, I do not believe that investing in theaters and sports stadiums should come at the expense of medical care and education. These are essential services that are critical to the well-being of individuals and society as a whole. Therefore, the government should strive to strike a balance between investing in cultural and social infrastructure and providing adequate funding for medical care and education.

In conclusion, while I agree that medical care and education are crucial, I believe that investing in theaters and sports stadiums can also have significant benefits for society. By creating jobs, stimulating economic growth, and providing opportunities for cultural and social enrichment, these facilities can contribute to the overall well-being of individuals and communities. However, the government should ensure that it allocates sufficient funds to medical care and education to ensure that these essential services are adequately provided for.

When I started my new career, I had to learn a number of new concepts and skills. My attitude changed immediately - I had a newfound respect for the importance of education and its ability to equip me with the necessary tools to be successful in my career. 

One particular subject that I did not think was important in school was mathematics. I felt it would never be applicable to my life or career so why bother learning it? But gradually, I came to understand the importance of mathematics skills in my job. Basic mathematical concepts are essential for tasks like counting stock, calculating payroll and monitoring financial data - all important parts of my job.

"There are a lot of advertisements that make products seem much better than they actually are. Some of these advertisements are false, while others are just misleading.

Some false advertisements that make products seem much better than they actually are are those that promise that the product will make you look or feel better. This is often done through the use of makeup, clothing, or accessories. Another common false advertisement is that the product will help you lose weight. This is often done through diet or exercise.

Another false advertisement that makes products seem much better than they actually are is those that promise to improve your health. This is often done through the use of supplements, medications, or surgery.

"A key component of achieving success in life is having good time management skills. Time is a precious commodity that can be wasted if not managed properly, and it's important to learn how to make the most of our day-to-day schedules. While there are numerous strategies for effectively managing one's time, three major components should always be considered: setting goals, organizing tasks, and maintaining focus. Setting goals helps to provide clarity on what needs to be accomplished each day. One must commit themselves by making realistic plans in order to stay organized; this means creating detailed lists with deadlines that will keep you motivated and help you stay focused when working towards your objectives. Additionally, prioritizing tasks from most important down to least important can help identify which items need immediate attention versus those that can wait for later completion. With well-defined objectives as a guidepost for daily action steps taken throughout the day, one’s productivity levels will increase significantly—as long as these goals remain achievable and at the forefront of their mind!. Organizing tasks comes next after goal setting has been established; this means breaking up larger tasks into smaller chunks so they are easier digestible pieces of work instead of feeling overwhelmed by all the things needing done at once. This could mean scheduling specific blocks throughout the day where certain activities occur or grouping multiple related jobs together that require similar skills — whatever works best within one’s lifestyle! For example, opting out of procrastinating by tackling small steps first thing in the morning followed by bigger projects around midday would ensure more progress is made before bedtime comes around again soon after nightfall hits hard again like clockwork…and so on! Having an “action plan"" written down also makes sure nothing gets forgotten along this journey too :). Finally, staying focused completes this trifecta triangle about effective time management—it requires willpower but it pays off big dividends every single time if done consistently over days/weeks/months

"I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College,because the Electoral College is process consists of the selection of the electors ,which the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President , and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.

They get to vote who is going to be but, the Electoral College is consists of the selection of five hundred thirty eight electors. The majority of two hundred seventhy electoral votes is requied to elect the president. I think that is not going to be alot of votes of people who is voting for the person who they want. Is just voters vote not for the president , but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Not always the voters can control whom their electors vote for!

The argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky, because the two thousand fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. They was lucky that happen , consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Perhaps the most worrying thin is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

The electoral college is unfair,outdated, and irrational. The arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality, and the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. There's five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president and those five reasons is certainty of outcome, everyone's president, swing states, big states, and avoid run-off elections. These five reasons have something to deal with Electoral College. Is just some arguments that they have of electoral college, in of defense of the electoral college.

Is just asking if the electoral college works? I think that it doesn't because they have arguments about it ,about they dont get that much votes. And that something is wrong with the electoral college. People should decide on what they want and that voters can control whom their electors vote! It can be a argued that the electoral college method of selecting the presisdent may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying thier state.

"Dear State Senator,

I personally believe that electing a President by popular vote  is a great way to elect the next president. The reason why I state this because ,when voting in an electoral college  the people are voting for a slate of electors instead of the President they want to be in office. But on the other hand,the popular vote declares the candidate that  recieved the most popular votes is the next president. We the peolpe want to vote for the next person to run our country , not a slate of electors.

Sometimes the election doesn't go as planned. Back in the election of 2000 Candidate Al Gore had more popular votes than Bush ,but Bush had more electoral votes and became President. I bet the people of America weren't to happy about that outcome , this was the first time this happened since 1888. Let's look at the election of 2012 , it states that our current President Barack Obama had ""recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney ."" It also states that residents of other regions that don't neccesary have electoral votes want a popular vote because "" residents of other regions are likely to feel disfranchised to feel that their votes dont't count that the new president will have no regard for their interest , that he really isn't their president ."" Now if the country went by a popular vote the peolpe would have a president that meets their needs and betters the economy for them instead of regions only getting what they want ,now everyone has their president. The President they voted for, not the slate electors.",1,89981a36458d4fa68cde92226c0ebad9
"Thick, foggy air is the future for this planet if we continue on this polluting path. Although, pollution is unavoidable in the industrial time we all live in. There are still ways people may help to limit the amount of pollution. With this information,the people of the earth need to limit their use of cars. For benefiting reasons such as, decreasing the deadly pollution, the lessening of stress, and economically saving.

Initialy, Pollution is increasing drastically and limiting car use will help decrease it. The usual effects of pollution from a car is the exhaust it lets out. Also, the factories that manufacture these cars are letting off smoke which in result pollutes the air people breath. In source 1 paragraph 5, it explains that passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to fifty percent in some suburban countries such as the United States. Therefore, the result of cars exhaust is hurting the environment and is one of the main causes of greenhouse gases. Source 2 paragraph 15, also states the cold nights and warm nights caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Explaining the air families and children breath is basically coming form a car's exhaust. Overall, pollution is a catastrophe and affects evryone dramatically.

Additionally, the stress of the average person can and will be lowered if the use of cars decrease. Stress can be cause by many things, but one of those things is the use of cars. Limiting the use of cars will really help any person relax. source 1 paragraph 3, Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, states she has been less tense and is much happier. Futher more without the use of a car this mother feels relaxed which enables her to be the mothe she wants to me. Source 3 paragraph 20 explains that leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. Knowing how stressful a traffic jam can be, limiting the use of a car will avoid that stress. To conclude, the strees relief of limiting the use of a car will impact evryone in a very beneficial way.

Lastly, there is an economic benefit to limiting the use of a car. A car cost alot to maintain and with all these expenses, its hard to find money to spend on ones self. Source 4, paragraph 32 explains the car use decreasing in america was caused by recession. The cash strapped americans had a hard time finding the money to spend on cars, which explains cars are a very expensive product. Overall, the economic impact will be beneficial to everyone because of the money saved to be used for different amenities.

To sum up, the limiting use of cars wont only help relieve stres or save money, but also help decrease pollution. Everyone would then be able to live a life knowing their childrens future will be bright. Instead of full with smog and smoke.",1,3543f5b5292b4144a654bbbb5b023ee7
"""Vauban's streets are completely 'car-free'--except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community."" WHAT?

I drive to Clearwater, Fl every week to get to practice and I know i would not be able to walk that far with all my equipment in time.

"Nothing like chilling in an 800 degree oven and having pressure thats 90 times greater than that on earth while studying a planet. Thats what it would be like to study Venus on its surface. But scientists want to some how find a way to study it, Safely. There are three big things that the author writes about in this article that may be a safe alternative or possobility to study Venus like floating above the atmosphere of venus, using simplified electronics made of silicon carbide, or using something called mechanical computers.

First things first the author talks about hovering above Venus's atmosphere to avoid all of the most of the dangers. High heat, crazy high pressure levels, Ect. The author of the article says, "" Just as our Jet airplances travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid all the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" This is a safe alternative to landing on the surface because it takes away the problems that they have been having all together. But the problem he has with this is that the only things they can do to study it is observe they can't take samples of rock, gasses, or anything else. But it will get them a basic view of the planet nothing much more.

Another thing that the author stated may work is using simplified electronics made of silicon carbide. This will help because because of the type of material. The author states within the article, "" Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks."" This is why it could help because it lasted three weeks where regular things couldn't even last 3 hours on venus without getting comepletly abliterated. So if they where made out of the silicon carbide they would be able to get it on Venus get samples of gasses, rock, and anything else they could find then get out of there before it gets destroyed hopefully.

The last thing that the author talked about that could work is using old technology called mechanical computers. The devises where envisioned in the 1800 and helped out in world war II. But the author says, "" The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all."" This would help because of the fact they could get it on Venus and not have to worry about the electrical boards of the vehicle frying. Because there will be no Electric envoleved in the process. If they made it out of a heavy duty metal or maybe even silicon carbide it may allow it to work on Venus and get samples of gasses, rock, and anything else on the surface of venus.

The three big things that may allow the exploration of Venus to be a possability are floating above the atmosphere of venus, using simplified electronics made of silicon carbide, or using something called mechanical computers. These ideas could help visually see the planet close up, Get on the planet safely, and move around the planet and get samples of evidence. This would help out NASA in the great race of space with all the things that they could discover from the planet of Venus. So while we are sitting here on earth one day there may be a man in a comepletly different situation of being in extreme heat and pressure. But all in all the author supports his idea and gives a few good options on how NASA could safely and efficiently get up to Venus and explore it.",1,c2c3249a5cba4a27a01bdcfa0b4fb6be
"Title: The Case for Limited Car Usage: Improving Environmental and Urban Health

The advantages of limiting car usage are manifold, promoting healthier societies as well as a more sustainable environment. The experiences of cities such as Vauban in Germany, Paris, and Bogota, in conjunction with emerging attitudes in the United States towards car ownership, underscore these benefits.

To understand the primary driver behind this shift, one must consider environmental concerns. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions; passenger cars account for 12 percent of such emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas in the U.S. (Rosenthal, ""In German Suburb""). In order to curb these harmful emissions, some urban areas have started planning smart, low-car suburbs with limited parking spaces and improved access to public transportation. Vauban, a suburb in Germany, for instance, has successfully executed this model, with 70 percent of its residents opting not to own cars (Rosenthal, ""In German Suburb"").

The experience of Paris offers a stark cautionary tale of high car dependency. In response to a severe smog crisis, the French capital had to enforce a partial driving ban, causing considerable disruption but resulting in a significant decrease in air pollution (Duffer). The driving ban also underscored the potentially salutary effects of limiting car usage on urban air quality, as seen in other cities as well. 

As Colombians have demonstrated, limiting car usage doesn’t mean giving up a mobile lifestyle entirely. During Bogota’s “Day Without Cars,” millions of residents turned to bikes and public transportation for commuting, effectively reducing air pollutants while promoting physical health and community solidarity (Selsky).

Meanwhile, in the United States, a cultural shift appears to be under way with increasing numbers of Americans buying fewer cars and driving less frequently (Rosenthal, ""The End of Car Culture""). This cultural change isn't solely rooted in environmental concerns; improved urban planning, the rise in telecommuting, and better access to public transportation have also contributed to the shift (Rosenthal, ""The End of Car Culture"").

All these examples underline the multiple advantages of limiting car usage. Not only does this lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, it also fosters healthier, more vibrant urban communities. By making the choice to drive less, citizens can contribute to the well-being of their cities and the planet, encouraging a sustainable lifestyle for the future generations. By supporting policies that promote alternative modes of transportation and planning smart, low-car suburban lives, we can accelerate this beneficial transition. In the balance are not just our suburbs and cities but also the planet's future.",0,5ad507bb859b407d80ea1803abf9d5e6
"Ah, the great smell of pollution hitting your face as you walk out the door; the way the polluted air puts a haze over your eyes. There is nothing better than that when you begin to start your day every morning. Most people do not seem to enjoy the slap in your face you get when you just cannot seem to get enough air into your lungs. The use of cars has be steadily decreasing over the years, and public transportations are beginning to be used more, and more. Along with this, cities are even beginning to ban the usage of cars. This has become an idea that has spread globally and everyone is beginning to take an interest to have the pollution level lowered, and to make the air much cleaner.

It is time to inform you, that places around the world big, and small are beginning to ban the usage of cars. Cities as big as Paris, France have banned car usage to bring down the pollution levels found in their great cities. Vauban, Germany, a suburban community, has completely given up their cars, in which car owners must purchase a spot for their car in a garage that can cost up to forty-thousand dollars. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in,

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , seventy percent of Vauban's families do not even own cars, and fifty-seven percent of the people living there chose to sold their cars before they moved there. Vauban's ideas has been spread throughout the world and now other suburbs are beginning to want to make places denser and make everything a walking distance away. Cities as great as Paris, France enforced a partial ban on driving cars to clear the air of the city, which was said by Robert Duffer in,

Paris bans driving due to smog.

Paris had made it easier to get public transportation while the ban was being enforced by making public transportation free of charge Friday to Monday. With pollution levels higher than ever with the amount of factories and cars, in congested cities it is a good idea for car usuage to go down to allow the air to clear from pollution. Limiting the amount of car usuage will clear the air we breathe, and allow us to inhale deeper breaths.

In addition, there are many different forms of transportation that can be used instead of just the average car, you may use bikes, roller-skates, skateboards (longboards, and penny boards), or even just a simple walk to get to places. Attempting to minimize the usuage of everyone using a single car to get to a place a carpool, taxi, bus, train, or subway can be another means of transportation that may be used. This will limit the amount of traffic on the streets, and minimize the amount of pollution that is going into the air. Some will say that not driving to your destination yourself will take more time whether it be because you have to wait for your specific train to arrive, or waiting for the taxi to show up to your doorstep, you have to wait a few extra minutes to leave for your destination. In reality, that few extra minutes you have waiting for the taxi can be stopped you can do this by, calling the taxi a few minutes before you want to leave so that it will arrive precisely when you want it too. With the use of bikes, walking, or skating everywhere you go, you will also begin to get into better shape, as you are moving towards your destination. The usage of cars for only trips that will take hours will also help to save you money on gas, and your car millage.

Furthermore, by beginning to add neat sidewalks, parks, and everything in a walking distance people will be encouraged to walk more and will not have reason not to use their car. Elisabeth Rosenthal states in,

The End of Car Culture , that even in America the usage of car is beginning to dtop down steadily. The amount of young people getting their driver's license is starting to decrease and has gone down twenty-three percent between 2001 and 2009. She also state at the Mobile World Congress the proposed the idea that they should partner with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety."" With people beginning to take interest in other means of transportation cities, and towns alike will begin to make things a walking distance to meet the obscure demand from the people.

In conclusion, people around the world are beginning to take interest in lessening the usage of cars in their cities, and towns. Cars have began going down in sales and less people are buying them. Other means of transportation have come up that will begin to benefit us health wise. Making us healthier by excercising and clearing our air of toxins found in pollution. If cities around the world begin to decrease the amount of car usuage our air will become much clearier and satisfying to live in. It will make getting to destinations much safer with the less chance of accidents and injuries from motor vechicles. Reducing car usage will begin to change the world by making it a much cleaner, healthier place to live.",1,32caadcb8ddd4da6b7177355bb73ee2c

Subject: In Support of the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider the importance of its preservation in our democratic system. While some argue for a shift towards a popular vote method for electing the President of the United States, I believe that the Electoral College provides crucial benefits that would be lost in such a change.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral votes, even though he won only 51.3% of the popular vote. This discrepancy highlights the importance of the Electoral College in preventing disputes over close elections. With the winner-take-all system in most states, even a slight plurality in a state results in a landslide electoral-vote victory. This system guarantees a clear victor and helps maintain stability and confidence in our electoral process.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the representation of all regions of our country. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which incentivizes candidates to campaign in various states and engage with a diverse range of voters. By requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College ensures that the president will represent the interests and concerns of citizens from different regions. This prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected and helps create a more united and balanced outcome.

Thirdly, the focus on swing states in a winner-take-all system encourages candidates to listen to voters and address their concerns more effectively. Voters in these states become highly engaged and informed, as they play a crucial role in deciding the outcome of the election. This leads to a more thoughtful electorate, ensuring that the most informed citizens have a say in choosing the president.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides a balance of power between large and small states. While the Senate's mal-apportionment can disadvantage large states, the Electoral College gives them more attention during campaigns. A candidate's victory in a large state like Florida will result in a higher number of electoral votes compared to a victory in a less populous state like Wyoming. This ensures that candidates do not solely focus on densely populated areas and consider the concerns of citizens across the country.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections by consistently producing a clear winner. This avoids the complications and delays that would arise if no candidate were to receive a majority of the votes. The certainty offered by the Electoral College allows for a smooth and efficient election process.

While some argue that a popular vote method would be fairer or more democratic, it is important to consider the practical benefits that the Electoral College provides. It ensures certainty, promotes the representation of all regions, encourages engagement in swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids run-off elections.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains a crucial element of our democratic system. Its preservation is vital to maintain stability, representation, and balance in our elections. I urge you to strongly consider these points when making decisions regarding potential changes to our electoral process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the information provided and make an informed decision that best serves our nation and its citizens.

"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my perspective on the matter of the Electoral College, a component of our constitution interwoven with the fabric of our nation's democratic process since its very inception. While the system has recently generated controversy with some critics advocating for a transition to a direct election for the presidency, I hold the view that the Electoral College should be maintained with possible minor modifications.

Undoubtedly, the criticism against the Electoral College is compelling. Proponents of a popular vote argue that the Electoral College can result in the election of a candidate who did not capture the majority of the popular vote, as noted in the situation from the 2000 election involving Al Gore and George W. Bush. They also express concerns about the so-called ""disaster factor"" in electoral voting (Plumer, 11) and point out the inherent unfairness in placing the power of election in swing states (Plumer, 13).

Despite these criticisms, however, I believe the Electoral College still provides numerous practical benefits that warrant its retention. Firstly, it often ensures a ""certainty of outcome"" (Posner, 18). Gold-standard examples such as Obama's 2012 victory, in which a minor popular vote advantage translated into a significant Electoral College share, illustrate this point well.

Perhaps one of the most important merits of the Electoral College is its promotion of a ""trans-regional appeal"" (Posner, 19). It encourages presidential candidates to address diverse regional concerns and creates a more inclusive political discourse. Meanwhile, it also prevents a fraction of the electorate, i.e., those from highly populous regions, from disproportionately influencing the outcome of the entire nation's leadership.

Moreover, the underlining principle of the Electoral College that provides a counterbalance to the inequitable influence of big states in the political process (Posner, 21) should not be discounted.

Finally, the Electoral College minimizes pressure for run-off elections by producing a clear winner even in situations where no candidate secures a majority of popular votes (Posner, 22), thus ensuring a smooth and efficient electoral process.

The potential for review and reform should not be completely ruled out. The possibility of refining the ""winner takes all"" system prevalent in most states, in favor of a proportional representation model adopted by Maine and Nebraska, can be examined. This could render a more accurate reflection of voters' preferences while preserving the fundamental elements of the Electoral College.

Before we make a radical departure from the tried and tested system established by our Founding Fathers, it is crucial to reflect on the rationale underpinning the inception of the Electoral College. The system was conceived as a mechanism to strike the right balance between election by Congress, hence protecting against potential government overreach, and election by the general populace, while ensuring equal representation across diverse regions. A sense of prudent consideration and cautious action is recommended in approaching this matter.

Let us proceed thoughtfully, understanding that this issue is not just about selecting a leader, but preserving the democratic essence of our nation's Constitution.

Thank you for considering my thoughts on this complex and vital issue. I believe our democratic process is robust and flexible enough to evolve with time, and it is my sincere hope that whatever the outcome, the decision strengthens our democracy and resonates with our shared values.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",0,e71e5beeaa48443c861655d3bc2a8217
"I disagree with this artical because is not always how you will see first impression is how you will see the person in general. Is not a great idea to change how you are to impres other people. Like for example I'm shy meeting new people but sometime I don't know what happen to me that I talk to people like I meet them before. Not all what you see is who it is sometime the apparance lies. People sometime lie to get something or someone. Other people do it to get attention because they fell alone and they change to get attention.

Other people do it to get attention because they fell alone and they change to get attention. I sometime do it to but only because I fell left out of the group so sometime I act diffrent. I don't like it but is the only way that I can get people attention. Some people will like if they are them self because you don't what to date sameone and that person is not the person that you see in the pictur. Other people like to deceive other poeple only for the money, to play around with them or be bad with you.

Like for example I'm shy meeting new people but sometime I don't know what happen to me that I talk to people like I meet them before. Sometime when I act crazy is becasue I like someone or because I need sleep but most of the time is when I'm in love. I am very weird to be around. I like to jock a lot but that dosen't change me who am I.

Is not a great idea to change how you are to impres other people. There are sometime that you have to impres other poeple like when you are trying to get a job. You have to look impresing so they can higher you for the job. Sometime it will need more then changing who you are. But most of the time you don't have to impres the people with the look you can impres with how good you are with the job. ",1,ac627b42aa0f4f5f9a9c45a90996e382
"Their are so many advantages of limiting car usage, for example having no car might even make someone happy, Heidrun Walter says ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Also driving cars can cause a lot of pollution, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the green house gas emissions in Europe. France had intense smog because of vehicles, it went 60 percent down after five days of no vehicle use.

Another benefit of no vehicle usage is instead of driving a car, you can go hiking, biking, skating , or take buses to your destination. ""It's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two seat bicycle with his wife. The day without cars has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, which is the most of any other Latin American city. Parks and sports centers bloomed throughout the city on the day without cars in Bogota.

Also, in the United States Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses. Instead of driving vehicles to work, one can carpool with a workmate. New York has a new bike sharing program anits skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect new priorities, aswell as car-sharing programs across the nation. Driving by young people decreased 23 percent as of 2001 to 2009.

Even though driving a car might get you to your destination quicker, it is better to go on a train, bike, skate, bus, taxi, carpool, or even walk because when you use a car too much you pollute the Earth. Biking, skating, and walking can also be fun sometimes, so stop driving a car and do something more alternative and less air pollutive, save the Earth.",1,dc01535207f4408c8e7594445d310382
"When most people need advice, they will ask more than one person in their search for answers. While they my be doing it out of instinct, or because that is what they have always done, there are actually several good reasons behind seeking multiple opinions when looking for advice. Collective intelligence, more choices, and even luck are just a few of the many reasons most people ask more than one person for advice when they need help.

Firstly, individual humans are generally less intelligent than the collective intellect of the species as a whole. This also works at a much smaller scale. For example, while a single scientist would struggle to build a spaceship, solve complicated equations, or write an advanced computer program, a team of individuals with different skills and ideas could complete each of those tasks in only a year. This same principle can also apply to seeking advice. A group of people is smarter than a single person, and it is usually the best idea to receive advice from the most intelligent being possible.

Secondly, asking only one person for advice can be risky because there is a possibility that the individual who was chosen might not be very intelligent, or they may not be extremely experienced with the problems that are being overcome. Asking more than one person for advice gives the person seeking advice better odds of finding someone who is intelligent and does have experience. This also gives the added benefit of having more options when deciding which piece of advice is the best for the current circumstances.

Finally, asking for advice can be useful for looking for opinions and viewpoints that have not been already considered. It can also be used to confirm that ideas or plans that have already been considered are the best option. However, it has already been mentioned that the ideas and viewpoints of just one person can be flawed. The ideas and viewpoints of a single individual are also usually just one set of ideas and viewpoints. Asking more than one person for advice is not only a way of receiving better advice, it also gives more complete advice. Multiple people usually have more than one set of ideas and viewpoints, and asking them gives the person asking more complete advice. As mentioned earlier, having multiple ideas and viewpoints also gives more choice between different solutions to the problem.

Overall, from a better set of choices, more collective intelligence, and even simple luck, asking more than one person is definitely a good idea when someone needs advice. A large group of people has more collective intelligence than any individual. A big group has a better chance of having someone who is experienced with the problem that is being solved. A large number of people also give more diverse viewpoints and choices for methods of solving the problem. In conclusion, one should definitely ask multiple people when they need advice.",1,cd7663d051fd43f99939c766d57a6b7a
"Theres so many roads in the world but traffic still exists. Ever think about the amount of cars in your neighborhood?, dont you think thats probably the reason why? In the Sources 1,2,3 , and 4 all emphasizes on how having a limit of car usage can be an great advantage to society. I believe that the limiting of car usage is an great advantage. This is true because Limiting care usage lowers pollution, Decreases traffic.

With that being said , Limiting car use lowers air pollution. I agree with this because the less cars driven leads to less burning fuel. According to the passage by Robert Duffer paragraph 10 states that ""After days of nearrecord pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""Due to the high population in Paris and numerous amount of the owning a vehicle causes massive car pollution. Having massive car pollution can be dangerous, this inherits sickness, stress and diseases. referring to the source ""Carfree Day is spinning into a big hit in bogota,Columbia"" Mayor Of Bogota Antanas Mockus stated that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" As he rode a two seater bike with his wife. The Mayor in this content speaks the absolute truth. As you walk to your destination in the nice warm air you relive stress and diseases that were causing you to be sick before. Those are the reasons why i think limiting car usage lowers the pollution.

Additionally, limiting car usage decreases traffic. This is true because if there is 5 people going to the same place you are and all of you guys drive in that one car or bus that reduces the traffic. Micheal siva In Source 4 The end of car Culture elaborate on that by saying ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before downturn, I Think that means something more fundamental is going on.""What or. siva means by this is that everyone should only have a certain amount of car per household and person Which will also lower the traffic. Traffic in paris is very long but due to the carfree act traffic was reduces. from reading source 2 by Robert Duffer ,it states ""Congestion was down 60 % in the capital of france Paris, after five days of intensifying smong."" Just in five days of no driving the air is already unpolluted imageded if you drived five days all day. Those are the reasons why i think that Limiting car usage is an advantage.

To Conclude,I believe that the limiting of car usage is an great advantage. This is true because Limiting care usage lowers pollution, Decreases traffic.",1,17c925473888436a97e8aba69729b765
"As a grade 11 student, I believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. The use of cell phones while driving has become a major concern for road safety, as it can lead to distracted driving, which is a leading cause of accidents on the road.

Firstly, using a cell phone while driving takes away the driver's attention from the road, which can result in accidents. According to statistics, texting and driving increases the risk of accidents by 23 times. This is because texting and driving takes the driver's eyes off the road, hands off the wheel, and mind off the task of driving. Similarly, talking on the phone while driving also takes away the driver's concentration, as they are focused on the conversation rather than the road.

Secondly, cell phone use while driving can cause drivers to miss important visual cues, such as traffic lights, pedestrians, and other vehicles. This can lead to accidents, as drivers may not be aware of their surroundings, causing them to make unsafe decisions on the road.

Furthermore, using cell phones while driving can also affect a driver's reaction time. In the event of an emergency, a driver who is using their cell phone may not be able to react quickly enough to avoid an accident. This is because their attention is divided between the phone and the road, which can slow down their reaction time.

In addition, the use of cell phones while driving can also lead to drivers engaging in risky behaviors, such as speeding or tailgating. Drivers who are distracted by their cell phones may not be aware of their speed or the distance between their vehicle and the vehicle in front of them, leading to dangerous situations on the road.

Finally, there are many alternative ways for drivers to communicate while driving, such as using hands-free devices or pulling over to make a call. These alternatives can help reduce the risk of accidents caused by cell phone use while driving.

In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. The use of cell phones while driving is a major concern for road safety, as it can lead to distracted driving, accidents, and dangerous situations on the road. Alternative ways of communication exist, and drivers should use these instead of putting themselves and others at risk.",0,d08fcda9904543d19585dacae7d3d612
"Although some people might say that students should use cell phones in the classroom for education purpose. Also some people might says that cell phones can effect students study and their grades in school, and it is not a good thing for students to having their cell phones in classroom.

However, not everyone agrees with this position,because cell phones can effect students health such as eyes problems if students look at it for a long time. And it can get students interest about games or social media or app for chatting. Additionally, there might be support for this idea that cell phones can help students to search on things or information that they are looking for in class. Also cell phones can help students easily to contact with their friends at school or to call their parents in an emergency situations.

Ultimately, this argument cannot stand because cell phones can effect students scores, students might be missing something important in the class while playing with cellphones. It seems like nothing but cellphones can destroy students future. The reason this idea is fallible that students cannot focus on class if they are using cell phones in the classroom.

Given these points, students might be get addicted to cell phones and cell phones will became a bad habit for students. One possible solution to this issue might be using cell phones only for an emergency problems or education problems. some students that can control the limit of using cell phones. Students better to use cell phone in the classroom when it is necessary, but not for the game or chatting with someone else.",1,57d3903d7db84f23b9125389c0c13484
"There are many ways to travel, and each has it's own advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of travelling in a group led by a tour guide.

On the plus side, travelling in a group can be much cheaper than travelling alone. This is because tour operators can get discounts from hotels, restaurants, and other businesses. Also, travelling in a group can be safer than travelling alone. This is because there is strength in numbers, and you will have someone to watch your back if you run into trouble.

On the downside, travelling in a group can be very restrictive. You will have to stick to the itinerary set by the tour guide, and you will not have much opportunity to explore on your own. Also, you will be surrounded by strangers, which can be uncomfortable for some people.

Overall, I believe that the advantages of travelling in a group led by a tour guide outweigh the disadvantages. If you are on a tight budget or are worried about safety, travelling in a group is a great option. However, if you prefer to have more freedom and flexibility, you may want to consider travelling alone or with just a few friends.

"Dear Senator, I have recently read some interesting information about a process of voting called ""The Electoral College."" It seems to work quite well in favor of getting the ""right votes"", however I do agree that there are too many possibilities and factors that could go against the public viewsand be in better favor of the government. As I recall, the government was set up for order and protection of the people. I am young and most people would probably judge the fact that I am so young to be stating things as politicalas this, however, I do seem to fathommore about political issues like thisand other things than most adults even know. Judging by the unbiased information I was given that shows me two sides of the issue, I'd say that though The Electoral College seems to work, there are so many factors that favor the government rather than the people.

On one hand, yes. The Electoral College does seem to work. It gives a fair amount of Electors to each state due to their Congressional Delegation and we are given the information that we, The People, are voting on the Electors rather than the President but there are too many factors to that. We must take into full recognition that electors do not have to be faithful toward the end to the President they were going to vote for in the beginning. We must also consider the fact that the Electors are people not in public Office. I am assuming that means that they must work for the government rather than in the public. I must state the possibilitythat there could very well be some possible, underhanded things going on in the government for the assurance that a particular Presidential Candidate is chosen to win the election, all based on the fact that they are chosen by the Electors. This came to mind because of paragraph 11, under ""Source 2: The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong."" Within this paragraph, it stated that the Electors need not be faithful to the President they said they would vote for in the election. As well as this, the government was made for the people and the people hardly seem the get an advantage with the Electoral College since we have to trust a group of human beings that could very well be unfaithful.

On the other hand, Electors not sticking to what they said rarely happens Or so we are told. As well as that, the Electoral College seems to work well and has a certainty of the outcome and avoids ""Runoff"" elections. However, the government was made for the public and therefor, I do believe that the people should choose their president as long as everyone is completely informed with uncensored information aboutb how everything is run, what that President, as well as what Congress and the other branches of Government intend to do whilst the current President is in Office. Many people don't even bother with trying to understand the way our government works and just completely trusts and goes along with whatever the government tells them but I think that is wrong!For a healthy government and a happy population, everyone must be informed with uncensored information and understand the outcome of these actionsand how it willl affect them in the shortterm and longrun. It is difficult and takes longer than what everyone would like but who wants to live in a so called ""Democracy"" that looks like a form of Oligarchy. Given the information I read, it doesn't seem fair or right. it seems like a form of control a form of Oligarchy a lie.",1,5dd4bc6d1c0448c4ad6dfa1dbc153157
"In today's fast-paced world, work has become an integral part of our lives. Many people believe that work nowadays is more stressful and less leisurely than in the past. I completely agree with this statement, and in this essay, I will provide specific reasons and examples to support my opinion.

Firstly, the modern work environment is highly competitive, and employees are expected to work longer hours to meet deadlines. In the past, people used to work for a fixed number of hours, and they had ample time to relax and pursue their hobbies. However, in today's world, people are expected to work for extended hours, and they often have to take work home. This leaves them with little or no time for leisure activities, leading to stress and burnout.

Secondly, technological advancements have made work more demanding and complex. In the past, people used to perform their tasks manually, which was less stressful and more leisurely. However, with the advent of technology, work has become more complex, and employees are expected to have a wide range of skills to perform their tasks efficiently. This has led to increased stress levels, as employees are constantly under pressure to learn new skills and keep up with the latest technological advancements.

Lastly, the modern work environment is highly competitive, and employees are constantly under pressure to perform. In the past, people used to work in a more relaxed and friendly environment, where they could take breaks and socialize with their colleagues. However, in today's world, people are expected to work in a highly competitive environment, where they are constantly under pressure to meet targets and deadlines. This has led to increased stress levels, as employees are constantly under pressure to perform and meet the expectations of their employers.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that work nowadays is more stressful and less leisurely than in the past. The modern work environment is highly competitive, and employees are expected to work longer hours, learn new skills, and constantly perform under pressure. This has led to increased stress levels, which can have a detrimental effect on the physical and mental health of employees. Therefore, it is essential for employers to create a more relaxed and friendly work environment, where employees can take breaks and pursue their hobbies, leading to a more productive and healthy workforce.

"After the research I have done I think that changing the system would be a good idea because of the followingg reasons, its not really fair because your not actually voting for the president, but for a slate of electors, also becuse of the candidates are more focused on the bigg states, and the swing states.

The first reason that changing the system is a good idea is that lots of people think that it is unfair. Like in source 2 by bradford Plumer, ""If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John kerry, You'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" but if the electors dont win the statewide election he wouldnt get the votes, so its like your vote didn't even count. The winner take all system is unfair because your actualy not choosing your own president.

The next problem are the big staes. The candidates dont spend many time is the small state because they now that those votes won't really help them win so the go to the bigger states where they now they will get more votes. In source 3 by Richard A. Posner says "" a large state gets more attention form presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state dose."" For example in 2012 obama won the votes from florida, get got 29 electoral votes. But if he were to go to a small state and won he would only get a few votes, so its not fair for the smaller states and it's not equal.

The finall issue are the swing states. Candidates focus more on the tossup states. In these states they spend more time and give out more information because in these states the people really pay colse attention to the campaign. The candidates dont spend any time int the staes they now they no chances for winning, that why during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all!

In response, based from the following informatom given I think that The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It should not be the elecotal votes that matter it should be the peoples votes. Also some states dojnt even hear from the candidates because they are busy with the big staes and trying to win over the swing states. If you do change the system you will make lots of people happy and I think that it will work out well for the U.S and everything will be equal.",1,222c1aa80fb54fcc87beda09b6717a52
"Dear Mr. Senator,

I have decided to express my opinon to you about the Electoral College process for electing the President of the United States. This process should be abolished as soon as possible for it is corrosive to the American peoples opinon. We should instead switch to a popular vote by eligble American citizens to decide presidency.

Now some fellows might argue that the Electoral College is favored by the people. When in fact, as Bradford Plumer points out in paragraph 9, ""60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"". Some people may also say that the Electoral college ecourages the president to visit all states, when in fact smaller states still are not treated the same as states with more electoral votes. A president would rather spend their time investing and giving information to a state such as Californa who have 55 electoral votes, who feel more inclined to think about their decision due to their involvement, rather than a state with 3 electoral votes who dont invest as much thought into their votes.

In grade school we are taught that popualer votes most accurately represent what a specific population wants, why dont we use it in the real world? If your princible wanted to figure out what color the students wanted their yearbooks, she would not elect people to decide for each class! In the Bush and Gore election, Bush recived less votes by the American people but won presidency because he accuired more Electoral votes than Gore. That means that more American people wanted Gore, but the fate was chosen by 271 people, who selected Bush as the winner!

The Electoral College also increases the risk of a tie and if one occured, the election would be disrupted by the unorderly process of which we would have to take to decide the president. In 1968, a change of votes from just 41,971 people would have tied the electoral votes due to the even number of 538 Electors.

The overall idea im trying to express is that the Electoral College is a poor way to show peoples opinon, and much rather focuses on that of 270 individuals who in the end, decide the President of the United States. I hope you can see my points and I long for the day when the president is decided by the people.",1,62ef6bce30f14646b7de4127986edc35

"Venus may be a worthy pursuit of study even with the dangers that come with this challenge due to the information that the author provided within this article.

The atmosphere on Venus is really thick to where it is close to impossible to see anything without being on the planet. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in size, density and in distance as well.

Venus could either be a good idea or a bad idea due to it's positives and negatives but we also don't know too much about Venus.

Some of the difficulties of trying to study Venus are really deadly in many ways. The atmosphere of Venus is 97 percent carbon dioxide which is extremely deadly and makes it really difficult to see Venus while off planet. The clouds of Venus are made of highly corrosive sulfuric acid which is obviously a problem toward the study. The planet's surface temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is at least 90 times greater than the pressure on Earth. These are some of the most hostile and extreme conditions of just about any other planet within the solar system.

Venus is also a necessary item of study due to the possibilities that could be created by studying the planet. Venus could have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system but it was a long time ago. It has been said that Venus was probably covered with oceans and bodies of water and other resources that could have supported multiple forms of life. The planet has many formations that are similar to Earth such as mountains, valleys and craters. Venus is our nearest option for a planetary expedition. The value of studying Venus is unchangable and can be unlimited depending on what could be found on Venus.

NASA has some ideas on how to get humans to Venus such as a blimp-like vehicle which can hover about 30 or so miles above the landscape.

Solar power would be plentiful, Radiation wouldn't be too high, and temperatures would be survivable. This vehicle would create survivable conditions for humans to complete their study and learn way more about Venus. NASA has tested using earlier technology made of silicon carbide which would survive in Venus conditions for about three weeks. The mechanical computer could be used for Venus because it is not electronical but it instead has mechanical parts which could be changed to have resistance to heat, pressure and other damaging forces.

There are many factors that can cause the Venus study and exploration to happen or to be dismissed. There are things that could be developed which can possibly make a way to study Venus without having too many problems. Also, there are many obstacles which are in the way of the study such as the planet conditions or the technology which would be required to develop the items needed for the study. There are many positives and negatives to this study but neither is greater than the other because there are ideas in the making about how to survive on Venus however there are many things which can get in the way of the development of the technologies. This study will probably take much time before it can actually be initiated because it will take time to gather everything that is needed and it will take some time to actually arrive at Venus and produce some results.",1,b4d4c9824a6f442a89b653d6d010a19c

Subject: The Value and Necessity of the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system and to urge you to continue to uphold its importance in our presidential elections. While some argue for a shift towards a direct national popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democratic process for several reasons.

First and foremost, the Electoral College provides certainty in election outcomes, as highlighted by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College."" Because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their popular vote percentage, disputes over the outcome are less likely compared to a popular vote system. This stability is essential in maintaining public trust in the election process.

Moreover, the Electoral College ensures that every region of our diverse nation has a voice in the presidential election. As Judge Posner points out, no region has enough electoral votes to singlehandedly elect a president. This requirement for trans-regional appeal encourages candidates to campaign and address a wide array of regional concerns, rather than focusing solely on the needs of highly populated areas. It fosters a sense of inclusivity and prevents regional favoritism.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its promotion of swing states. In swing states, which offer a more balanced distribution of voters, candidates are compelled to focus their campaign efforts to win over these crucial swing voters. This practice benefits all voters, as those in swing states tend to be more engaged, informed, and thoughtful in their decision-making. By empowering these voters, we ensure that the most considered individuals have a say in electing our president.

Furthermore, the Electoral College safeguards the influence of larger states. Due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, large states can lose some political weight. However, the Electoral College rectifies this issue by giving more attention to states with larger populations. As Judge Posner highlights, a narrow victory in a large state like Florida results in a significant number of electoral votes, whereas a similar margin in a smaller state like Wyoming would yield fewer electoral votes. This balances the influence of big and small states, ensuring a fair distribution of power.

Lastly, the Electoral College offers a solution to potential run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, which could complicate the presidential election process, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. It streamlines the election process and avoids the need for time-consuming and costly run-offs.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate is unlikely to win, it is important to note that voter turnout is not solely contingent on the possibility of influencing the outcome. As evidenced by the high turnout in the 2012 election, citizens engage in the electoral process to express their political preferences and be part of shaping our democracy.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a cornerstone of our democratic system. It ensures certainty in election results, prevents regional favoritism, encourages candidates to cater to swing states, balances the influence of larger and smaller states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. I urge you to defend the Electoral College and reject any efforts to replace it with a direct national popular vote.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust in your commitment to safeguarding our democratic institutions and upholding the principles upon which our nation was founded. If you require any further information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]",0,34597e0b76984876b9fa9c82329b1829

    The debate over whether or not smartphones are a positive or negative addition in the classroom has been going on for some time. There are arguments to be made for both sides, each with their own arguments for and against their usage in school. On one hand, cell phones offer students many advantages, such as the ability to access a vast amount of information quickly and efficiently. Additionally, using a smartphone gives students more flexibility when it comes to accessing their course materials and can also allow for increased collaboration among students. On the other hand, there are negatives associated with using a cell phone in the classroom, including distractions, increased potential for cheating or sharing answers, and a lack of focus on the lesson. 

When compared to using computers in the classroom, cell phone use offers a different set of advantages and disadvantages. For instance, using a smartphone may offer the same ability to access a large amount of information quickly and efficiently but there may be fewer distractions. Additionally, smartphones are much more affordable and accessible than computers. Unfortunately, smartphones also often have more limitations than computers on what kind of tasks can be done. 

The effects of using phones in the classroom can be wide-ranging and depend largely on how phones are used. If students are using their phones during class time for learning purposes, it can be beneficial. However, if they are using it for social purposes, such as texting or checking social media, this can lead to a decrease in focus and engagement. It can also lead to an increase in cheating or sharing information during tests or exams. 

Ultimately, while smartphones can have both positive and negative effects in the classroom, there are steps that can be taken to manage their use. Schools can implement policies that limit the types of activities that students can do on their phones, such as prohibiting social media use, or restrict their use to certain times during the day. Additionally, schools can educate students on responsible phone use and provide resources for academic support. These steps can help ensure that students are using their phones in a responsible way that will still allow them access to the resources they need to succeed.",0,8d726ad072754219bafe2b28c0c52a84
"What would you do without car usage? Is there such thing as too much or too little car usage? Many residents or travelers are nearby thier destination and don't nessesaraly need a car to get there. Although, for other's they may need to use a car becasue of extended distance. Limiting car usage has many advantages.  For example, in Vauban, Germany streets are completely ""car free"". According to the article "" 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57% sold car's to move here"". Families and friends are much active with each other and can spend more quality time outside of school and work.

When there is less car usage more public transportation will be available to thoose who need it more importantly. Also there would be less polution with the gas and air. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"", said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. Due to the smog that was in France, car's was banned. ""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday"", according to the BBC. Fuel is also a great impact. Do you ever feel like you just work hard for nothing? Money is being wasted on gas, car materials, and car details much more then the things it really needs to be spent on.

Limiting car usage could mean less accidents. Less accidents means less deaths and injuries. Driving could be risky especially in crowdy places with people and other cars. Limiting cars could also mean people getting to know diffrent places often and not just the places they are used to going. Parks and sports centers also have had bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramtically cut traffic; and new resturants and upscale shoppung districts have cropped up. Families are more engaged together and work together to make it to thier destination.

In conclusion, Do you feel as if car polution should be limited becasue of all the advatages. Limiting car usage has it advantages and disadvatages. Many things could possibly happen. According to The end of Car Culture article, ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportations traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve recources, lower emissions and improve saftey"". The Mobile World Congress is looking for more saftey ways to transport and get to yout destintation when needed. Due to limiting car-usage families and friends can now spend quality time while getting to thier locations, you can go to your nearby places, you could save more money of gas and car details, and also you could prevent less accidents if possible.",1,fbcfa1c3703d47c6b33986b12b342050
"The author presents the reader with the idea that studying Venus is worth all the dangers and risks. They made sure to point out that travels should not be limited by the dangers and risk of the travel but expanded to meet the edges of imagination and challenges. The author has done well supporting their idea of the worthiness of studing Venus. They have shown and explained both the dangers and perks to studying Venus, plus the ways around the risks.

The author has described the negative, dangerous conditions of Venus's surface and atmosphere. ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than whate we experience on our own planet"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). The author is showing how dangerous the conditions can of Venus can be and how they are more extreme than anything humans have face on Earth. The author shows the readers a way that humans can study Venus that is much safer, along with technologies that will increase the information that humans back on Earth will recieve. ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray..."" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This shows that scientists are coming up with ways to make exploring Venus a little safer, still not the easiest conditions but survivable enough to gain more information on the captivating planet. The author explains that there are other approaches to studying Venus, such as simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that can last up to three weeks in the conditions of Venus and the possibility of using old technology is also in the air. ""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers..."" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Since modern computers are delicate when it comes to extreme conditions, mechancical computers, that have mechanical parts, can withstand more pressure, heat, and other conditions that it will face on Venus. This evidence shows that people are looking for a way to make exploring safer and striving to meet more intimidating endeavors. The strive to meet challenges will give us more ways and technologies to explore more of Earth and other planets similar to that of Earth.

The author has done well in supporting his idea by showing both sides, the dangers and worthiness and steps scientists are taking for exploring Venus. With the work towards meeting the challenges faced on Venus, exploration will not only give insight of the planet but also will lead humans into many equally challenging, intimidating endeavors. There is much to be explored and humans need to rise to the challenge, finds ways around the danger, and expand to the ends of imagination and innovation.",1,d6afec518507435a82729705a94569c1
"When needing advice due to a problem in life, people often go to someone to ask for advice and they generally go to multiple people to ask advice. For many people this can seem peculiar, going to multiple people for advice might seem point less to some, but when thought about, this method is a helpful way to make a better choice. By using the method of asking multiple people for advice, this could help someone make a better choice by doing this the person could see the problem from different perspectives, the person could get information that the other person asked didnt know, and there is the off chance that the person could be getting biased advice from the person without knowing. In all asking for advice from multiple people is helpful and is recommended to many people when dealing with a problem where they can use some advice with a problem they are struggling with.

If a person has a problem, a challenge most have is seeing it from other's perspective, sometimes a problem can only be solved when you take a step back and try to look at in a new way, and talking to multiple people concerning the topic can help someone do this. For example, say someone got into an argument with a friend after being offended by something the friend said, after they talked to multiple people about this they then could see that the friend didnt mean to offend him/her. If the person had not gone to someone else for advice then they wouldn't have realized that the friend was sorry and didnt mean to offended him/her, by talking to multiple people it helped them make a better choice. Besides helping people look at their problem from a different perspective, talking to multiple people can still help people make better choices in other ways, they could get information from someone that the previous people that they talked to didnt know, and the information could help influence their decision.

When people have a problem they seek advice from those around them, a major reason to asking multiple people for advice is that one of the people that is asked could be someone who has information that the others didnt know, or withheld. For example, in a 6rd grade class there was a boy who had trouble in history class, there was a history test on the following Friday, the boy was worried so he asked his best friend, Generic_Name what he should do, Generic_Name told him not to stress and that to study and he'll be fine. He trusted his friend's advice but asked his other friend, Generic_Name, just to be sure, his other friend told him that the test was 20 questions mostly surrounding the declaration of independence, after getting this information he studied his notes surrounding the declaration of independence and ended up getting a 98% on his history test, due to knowing what to expect. The boy at first only asked his best friend but after getting advice from another person, he understood what the test was about and what he should do. This method of asking multiple people for advice helped him and if he had not asked his other friend for advice, he would have been unprepared for the test. Besides the reasons to ask multiple people for advice, getting a different perspective and getting additional information,there is still another major reason to ask multiple people for advice, which is on the off chance that the first person(s) they asked were biased, and didnt give them direct information based on facts and not opinions.

Everyone is life will eventually have a problem that they struggle with, and the best course of action is to ask for advice from others around them, but to make sure that they are making a good choice they should get advice from multiple people, not just because of the needed perspective or the need for additional information, but because there is always a chance that the first person asked is giving biased advice. For example, at lunch there was an argument between 4 friends about DC vs Marvel movies and a mutual friend of the 4 was forced to chose a side in the argument, the mutual friend had never seen a DC or Marvel movie and didnt know anything about them, she went to ask advice about which side to choose from one of her friends that was on side DC, they told her that DC was better in special effects, plot and actors. She trusted her friend's advice but to make sure she had all the information she asked her older brother, someone who had seen all DC and Marvel movies and wasnt someone who had picked a side and genuinely supported both sided, her brother told her that DC and Marvel were both amazing franchises, but generally Marvel had a bigger budget and that they had more plot detail. After talking to her brother and her friend, she came to the conclusion that she believed Marvel was better franchise wise. The girl at first did not know what to do and after consulting her DC friend she was convinced DC was better, but after talking to her brother, who didnt chose a side, realized that she, personally, supported Marvel. If she did not go to another source for advice then she wouldn't have known that her DC friend was biased and embellished on a lot of details. With all of this it clear that asking for advice from multiple people helped her chose a better choice.

In conclusion, whether someone has a small problem like which franchise they support or if its a more intricate problem like a miss communication that could destroy a life long friendship, no matter how big or small the problem is asking advice is always something that helps and asking multiple people for advice could help make a better choice when dealing with a problem. Asking multiple people helps when someone needs a new perspective, additional information of the topic or if they just arent sure if the person they are getting advice from is biased.

In all asking for advice from multiple people is helpful solution and is highly recommended to many people when dealing with a problem where they can use some advice with a problem they are struggling with.",1,b09e6b7fb7614fcbb07d7682fedc6dc0
"When it comes to learning English, many people believe that both reading and speaking are equally important skills. However, I believe that speaking is more important for Chinese learners.

There are a few reasons for this. First, Chinese learners have to learn how to construct sentences in English. This means that they need to be able to understand and use proper grammar. Second, Chinese learners need to be able to communicate with native speakers. This means that they need to be able to understand and use proper pronunciation. Finally, Chinese learners need to be able to understand and use idiomatic expressions.

All of these skills can be learned through speaking. Chinese learners can practice their grammar and pronunciation by listening to English audio recordings and watching English videos. They can also practice idiomatic expressions by listening to English conversations and reading English texts.

In contrast, reading is not as effective for Chinese learners when it comes to learning English. Reading is good for learning vocabulary and basic grammar. However, Chinese learners need to be able to understand and use idiomatic expressions in order to be able to communicate with native speakers.

Therefore, speaking is more important for Chinese learners when it comes to learning English.

"In recent years, there has been a growing trend to limit car usage in various parts of the world. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use and promote alternative forms of transportation. The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and range from reducing greenhouse gas emissions to improving public health and creating more accessible communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, with passenger cars alone accounting for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can make a substantial impact on reducing these emissions and mitigating their effects on climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have positive effects on public health. As the number of cars on the road decreases, so does air pollution, which has been linked to various respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, by promoting alternative forms of transportation such as walking and cycling, we can encourage a more active lifestyle and improve overall public health.

Limiting car usage can also create more accessible and sustainable communities. Instead of relying on personal vehicles, smart planning focuses on creating compact communities that are designed to be easily navigable by foot or public transport. This approach allows for the placement of essential amenities, such as shops and services, within walking distance, reducing the need for long-distance car travel to meet everyday needs. By making communities more compact and accessible, we can reduce sprawl and preserve green spaces.

Moreover, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion, particularly in densely populated areas. By promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as public transit, carpooling, and biking, we can reduce the number of cars on the road and ease congestion. This not only reduces travel times for individuals but also improves overall traffic flow in cities.

While the idea of limiting car usage may seem daunting to some, it is a necessary step towards creating more sustainable and livable communities. Initiatives such as car-free days and the promotion of alternative forms of transportation have already shown promising results in various parts of the world. By embracing smart planning and reducing our reliance on cars, we can make significant strides towards a greener and more sustainable future.",0,82c5afff2501407b98f6be5bb3afecb6

"For years, people have been telling others that the natural landform on Mars is actually a face created by aliens. I as a scientist believe that it is also a landform coinencidently in the shape of a face. There are multiple reasons why I and many other scientists feel this way.

We have tried multiple times to photograph this landform and have succeeded. It appears to majority of us, that it is not more than a natural landform. We have took many precautions into making sure that it isn't an alien artifact. For example, it's like the man on the moon. It just happened to be there naturally and created itself over time. You are of course entitled to your own opinion, but that doesn't make it a fact.

In conclusion to this theory, it is not more than just a theory. We are not hiding anything from the world. Something like this I'm sure we'd be more than happy to share with the rest of the world in our amzing findings. We could be wrong, that is so. But, we're pretty positive it's just a landmass.",1,8052173dc6d64ba991734057288c51ea
"Have you ever seen a face on Mars? A landform has been found on a region of Mars called Cydonia. Many argue that the the Face is either a natural landform or a landform created by aliens. Many information from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" can help come to a conclusion. The ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform.

The first supporting evidence to the claim is that the face would benefit NASA if the Face was made by aliens like people said. Real evidence of aliens would be an informational outbreak. NASA would be credited for an outstanding discovery, so why would they hide a true theory from arguing skeptics?

Second, several other natural landforms are just like the Face on Mars. The picture shows its reseblence to landforms common around western America. Mars Global Surveyor, Garvin, stated, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Also, The resemblence was ""formed by shadows giving the illusion of"" a face showing it is just a mesa.

Lastly, supporters of the alien theory believed the Face has alien markings that are hidden. They thought this because of wispy clouds in front of the camera taking the picture appeared. Because ""you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size"" anyone could see the alien markings they speaked of.

The alien conspirancy of the Face located on the Red Planet can be proven false. Details from ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" can support it is just a natural landform, a mesa. These unknown, mysterious aliens people speak of did not build the Face on Mars.",1,ab14ca6d077646968acb31dcf896781a
"January 23rd, 2015 Greetings or. Senator, There is one particular issue that has been boggling my brain recently. It is none other than the electoral college system. Irrational, unfair , and outdated is exactly what the electoral college system is. Isn't the virtues of American's built on foundations such as rationality, equalityfairness, and mobility? The head of the United States government isn't even elected to the standards that we, the American people, hold ourselves to.

or Senator, I agree with the clause ""majority rules"" to an extent, with ""winner takes all"" being on the whole other side of the ball park. If Americans had a straight voting system, meaning no electoral college, where simply stated, whichever candidate recieves the most votes wins, the process in which we elect our government head would hold truer to our values. With our current system, hundreds of thousands of Americans votes don't matter. This mass of people is citizens of eligibility to vote. Where are there rights? What does this say about our system? The ""winner takes all theory"" ignores voters. If a state leans 51% democrat, then the entire state is accounted for the democratic party. What about those 49% of republicans. Where does their vote go? down the toilet along with the credibility and accuracy of the electoral college.

Now, if this predicament occurs in near half of our 50 states, a candidate who did not recieve the popular vote will reign triumphant over a candidate who a majority of the American people elected to be their new president. According to, ""The Indefensible College"", by Bradford Plummer, Americans lose out on more than just an accountable vote. Candidates don't even spend time in the states they are certain of having no chance in winning. Logically, candidates only spend their time in the ""swing states"" where they could possibly steal al of that states electoral college votes lines 1320. Shockingly 17 states didn't see a single candidate during the 2000 election lines 2021. We sure did suceed and ignoring hundreds of thousands Americans there.

This neglect isn't the fault of the candidates though. Where shall i place the blame, or. Senator? There is no childish, frivilolus blame to be placed. Simply stated, the fault lies in our electoral college system. The candidates are just playing the game of the electoral college. The counterclaim for my argument may suggest that the certainty of outcome and the expulsion of runoff elections is enough to substantiate the electoral college. Are you saying that America doesn't have the time to recount votes to ensure the prosperity of the American people. Is that the messege you want to project? It sure isn't coming off well.

The certainty of outcome is ludicrous as well. Source 3, ""In Defense to the Electoral College"", even admits that the electoral college is a nondemocratic method of selecting a president lines 1517. Liars, we are liars then. Americans project an image of America to the world that we are a peacful democracy. However, if the way that we select our leaders isn't even democratic, why are we portraying this false mirage. The electoral college is an anachronism lines 15 16. We are a stage four country on the demographic treansitions model. Therefore, our aspirations should be looking forward and not rooted in the past.

or. Senator, I know you are a sensible man who cares about the people he represents. The people's right to vote matters, yes? Do not be so arrogant as to ignore the people who elected you. May I direct you to the preamble to our constitution? Isn't that the sole foundatio of our government? The electoral college system is a mock of the American people and an outdated idea that does not fit in with our current state as a whole. A win by the popular vote is much more commendable by a landslide victory on false pretences.",1,70e7a681fa0b45aca6ee6e5d9aa31b6b
"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College is an anachronism. It belongs in the past and should not decide who are president is going to be anymore because its not who the majority of people really want to be leading,it could cause a tie,and its unfair to voters.

Abolishing the electoral college has been a thing people have wanted gone for some time. Because of the electoral college the popular vote has not effected who becomes president. According to the article,(The Indivisible Electoral College),over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election tha the one we have now. this means many people would rather switch out the electoral college with a direct vote. With the electoral college still up voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose again.

Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in an election. According to the article,(The Indivisible Electoral College),if the election was a tie it will be thrown to the House of Representatives,where state delegations vote on the president.This mean that people would still have no say in the matter of choosing a president.

At the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnner take system in each state canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in. According to the article,during the 2000 campaign,seventeen states didnt see canidates at all. This means voters didnt even have a chance to vote.

The electoral college should be ruled out in the future because its not who people really want to lead,it could result in a tie, andits unfair to voters. If its removed then there would be better leaders in the future.",1,441b5ddbb0954148bba8cccfd38ec3aa

When it comes to having someone attempt to make drastic changes to our personalities, it can be a difficult and often confusing topic. On one hand, it can be helpful to learn from others how to be more understanding, or to appreciate a different perspective. On the other hand, if someone is trying to pressure us to be something we are not, it can bring about negative consequences.

It is important for all of us to remember that we all bring something unique to the table. We should not feel ashamed to express our individual views and experiences in a respectful manner. Furthermore, we should try to accept the differences between us, whether we agree or not, to foster healthy relationships. 

At the same time, being open to constructive criticism is beneficial. We all have areas in our lives we could work on or need guidance; a person who offers feedback or suggestions in a kind and patient manner should be seen as an ally. Attempting to better ourselves should be appreciated, though we should be wary of someone wanting us to change just so they are comfortable. 

Ultimately, it is best to strive for a balance between embracing new insights while also preserving our core identity. We need to be accountable for how we conduct ourselves but not necessarily cave into the demands of another person. ",0,2d33e32444604fc1ad402ebc993a4096
"Should the Electroal College be removed? Thats been the arguments, talks, and thoughts over many years. If they we'er to ask me, I would absolutly say ""Yes The Electroal College should be removed."" But many people ask ""why?"", to me it's simple. All the votes that ""U.S Citizens"" make every four years, never really goes directly to the runners for presidents. They always go to people who decide weather or not they should be approved, wich abviously the should if their whole or majority of the state voted for him/her. But thats not what the the feel, they feel like they need to aprove the runners. ""why?"", you ask? I'm not sure. If they need to do all that, why dont the people of the House Of Representatives just make their decisions?

Asking people for advice is such a natural thing to do, that we sometimes dont even realize when we are doing it. Everyone needs guidance, but not everyone wants it. I think seeking other peoples opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can see it from another perspective, you receive guidance, and it could help you make a rational decision.

No one is the same, so everyone has a different way of doing things. We all see things a little differently; which is what makes us all unique. If you have a problem or situation, and you cant decide what the best approach would be, you should ask someone else what they would do. They will most likely be glad you asked them, and give you their opinion on the situation. Having a different point of view can sometimes help you see things in a different light. You may change your mind, or decide to stay with your original thought or plan. Either way, it will help you get one step closer to solving your problem.

Humans need guidance to live, because without it we wouldn't know how to do anything on our own. We needed guidance to take our first steps, we needed guidance to ride a bike, we even needed guidance to learn how to put our own shoes on every morning. We would live in a world of chaos if we didn't have the guidance we need from our family, teachers, and friends. Nothing would make since, and we wouldn't be able to function properly. Asking for guidance on what to do is not a bad thing, and we should all do it more often. Sometimes you just don't know what to do; which can cause people to make bad decisions. Asking for help or guidance could potentially help you, even if it does not seen that way at first.

If you are having a problem, and you are stressed out; it can lead you to do things in ways that are more problematic then they are helpful. Everyone's brain processes things in a different way that helps them, although sometimes the things that seem like good ideas in the moment, may only make things worse. Sometimes when we ask someone that is calm, then we can find other ways to deal with the situation in a way that will actually help. It may even give you some time to calm down. One irrational decision or action could ruin everything, so it is important to ask someone else what they would do.

I think seeking for other peoples opinions can help someone make a better choice because you see it from a different perspective, you receive guidance, and it could help you make a rational decision. Of course we all need to learn how to solve things on our own, but no one ever said we couldn't have some help along the way. Even some of the smartest people had to ask for help. No one ever accomplished anything without any advice, so why should we have to?",1,ef9501ac96ab4148941287799d3ef0fd
"Imagine that it's 6:00am, Monday 2026 and you wake up to the smell of gasoline, fuel, and fogged air; you look outside and all you see is car after car commuting to one's everday life and spreading pollution every where. Cars are used way to often by many people who don't even need it most the time. If you do your part and limit car usage only good things will come to the world. Limiting car usage in todays' environment sounds like a difficult thing to do since people work, go to school, etc. but in reality limiting car usage is saving the environment around us and by saving the environment you are saving yourself.

The high number of car usage is polluting our environment in numerous ways due to the smog it creates that corrupts the air. Sometimes it takes seeing what one is doing to stop and think about how they are affecting it. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city ( Source 2, Paragraph 10)"". You can see that because of the increased pollution in Paris they put-forth a law to limit the car usage in the city. If you limit usage than progress in the environment will occur. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog ( Source 2, Paragraph 14)"". In only ""five-days"" more than half of congested pollution decreased due to the limiting of car usage in that area. Cars can just destroy the atmosphere but we as people can make a big change by just walking or riding a bike in the times where you don't need a car and just doing that is a great way to decrease pollution by limiting your car usage.

Some places and people in the world seem to thrive without cars in their everyday system. People who don't own cars seem to have less stress in their life. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way... ( Source 1, Paragraph 3)"". In some areas of the world the government has days to support the limiting of car usage by banning them for a temporary time. ""BOGOTA, Colombia- In a program... millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took busses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" ( Source 3, Paragraph 20)"". Having a day free of cars has a great chance of decreasing some of the modern stresses of life. Living a life without cars even if it is for a certain period of time is helpful in reducing the pressure on ones' life and gives nature a fighting chance on this planet.

Limiting car usage is beneficial to world whether the impact is small or large it all plays a good part in protecting our health and the environment around us. People have made changes some take to the extreme others don't do something about it until they see for themselves what it does. If one limits their car usage then they are being a great benefactor and get to experience the advantages of it. You stop imagining and now you think ""I'm going to ride my bike to school today"".",1,4df338de95c741349a9f8775c646522d
"Dear State Senator, I think that our president's should be chosen by popular vote because they have better chances of winning and they will know how many people agree with what they are trying to do in the United States.

The president's have better chances of winning because they can have the most votes and wouldn't have to wait on the Electoral College. Such as paragraph 9 says, ""Thanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" I think that was unfair because Al Gore could of been the president but instead he was not, after all the campaigning he did to get those voters to vote for him it ended up as a waste because the voting didn't get him anywhere. If I was a president I would be highly upset because I knew I could have a big chance of losing just because of the Electoral College. What doesn't make any sense to me is that the voters are not voting for the president but are voting for a slate of electors. What's the whole point of voting then? People are out here voting for electors that they don't even know and most of the electors are people who not holding public office. In paragraph 13 it says, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" To me they are cheating people out of their votes, people vote for the one that they think could make a change not just voting just to be voting.

The president would know how many people agree with what they are trying to do in the United States. The electoral college votes won't help them know who is really for them and who's not because if someone win over electoral votes there are going to be people out there mad about the fact that they had won. This will make people not want to vote at all because 9 times out of 10 the person they are voting for gone lose. The electoral college just makes it difficult for the people that are running for president. I'm not saying that it should be easy to just become something big, but if you worked hard enough I think that you should be honored enough to become president through popular votes. This will make the incoming president feel appreciated for all the hard work they did to recieve all these votes. They will know that what they are trying to set forward is good for some people and not just for them. Such as paragraph 12 says, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" What would happen then? That's why you should just give it to the person with the most votes because they deserve it.

I hope what I have really proved my argument that we should change the way a president is chosen so it can be fair to everyone. I think this will make the incoming president feel confident in himself to make this happen.",1,3e34a4f2f4c0403889866c2ef35c265d
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depiste the dangers in presents"" Anyone would love to explore more than just the Earth we live on. Who wouldn't want to know more than what we know already about our planet Earth! Venus is one of the most interesting planets we would want to find more of or know about especially because Venus is our friendly neighbor other than Mars. Venus can be a challenging planet to study, and a very dangerous planet but it can end up being worthy information.

The author uses very good details to describe why Venus is a interesting planet to study. The way the author started off with "" Venus is sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky..."" is a very good way to drawl people into the topic of why Venus can be a worthy pusuit despite the danges it presents. Venus is the one of the closest plants to Earth and people often refer it to Earth's ""twin' because of the density and size. Venus can be a really challenging planet to study, the way the author used a details about the atmosphere and surface in paragraph 3 sounds even more challenging then what i thought. ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dixoide..."" the author even stated that something even more challening than the 97% of carbon is the clouds! it has ""highly corrosive sulfuric acid"" doesn't that sound interesing but terrifying? The author stated that humans have sent numerous of spacecraft to the land but none of them have survived more than just a few hours.(paragraph 2).That just adds another reason to why Venus is a worthy pursuit to study. I know more scientist are mostly focused on studying Mars more than any other planet but the author is putting the spotlight on Venus and it's full of mystery's. The author also states that the average surface temperature is over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the pressure is 90x greater than what we experience on Earth, ISN""T THAT INSANE !!! imangine living on Venus and discovering all these other things we didn't even know that it exists. Venus is also being described to once being just like earth long long time ago. Venus still has some features that can be found on earth such as rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters (paragraph 4) this should be most definitely be another reason for humans to study Venus the way they study Earth and Mars. Each planet always has something different within each other, but we can't really study planets futher away from earth like Pluto. Pluto isn't referred to being a planet but it is in our glaxay so it should be considered one, we can't really study those planets well like the Mars, but Vensus is another option to study.

The author used a very good reasoning for Venus to be a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The Earth, The Moon, and Mars should not be the only planets scientists or NASA studying. Venus most likely has more interesting, mysterious places or objects than just the atmosphere and the surface. Venus sounds like one great and definitely a worthy planet to study.",1,040d7d39b928446da461e040dc14a493
"Have you ever thought of the world without no cars? Some people would say it would be outrageous for that to happen, but it has been proven that cars may be actually killing the planet that we live on which is a really big deal. So lets think for a minute how many advantages could come out of not using cars anymore in modern society.

The smog; the smog is whats killing the earth and messing up the clean air. (Paragraph 10 Source 2)

Even Americans are just not buying as many cars and has been declining from its peak since 2005. (Paragraph 32 Source 4)

Roads, Parking Lots, and Gas Stations take up most of the U.S and without cars we could use a main street and have shops on it and could walk or ride our bicycles. (Paragraph 6 Source 1)

First off, cars are just going out of style they are not as popular as they were 10 years ago. In 2005 they reached their peak of selling cars and people getting their licenses but ever since then it been going down hill. Also as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9% below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. (As stated in Paragraph 32 Source 4) There has also been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license. (Stated in Paragraph 38 Source 4)

Second, it would clear up alot of used space that Parking lots, Gas stations and Highways take up. We could use this new space for a Main Street and have shops along the street and people could use their bicyles or they could even walk to the places and go shopping. This would be a very good ide for a small Suburban town with some shops and a Main Street. I do however understand it may be a little more difficult for a big city but im sure there is a way to work something out.

Third, I think this is the biggest problem with cars, the smog. Smog plays the biggest role in killing our planet but whether it be from Cars or Factorys it still hurting us and there are ways that we could stop it. There is a way that we could stop this pollution and harmful effects to the earth such as; hybrids or plug-in cars.

All in all there are many reasons that cars should be abolished but yet there are still a few exceptions to this and until proven cars will still be here. Just next time you get in a car think about what it may be doing to the earth or so-on.",1,bc8e92ba08874835a6cecdbf01e7aee9
"Exploring Venus has its pros and cons. Both have its challenges and risks. Venus is a very interesting planet to study due to the fact that it is the only one like earth, but there are risks. throughout this essay I will tell you my reasoning on why the author didn't exactly prove to me that Venus is worth taking risks for.

It states in paragraph two,"" Each mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in the more than three decadeas."" This peice of evidence shows that Venus is not a safe enviroment for electronics to land on so why would you potentially send humans to this planet even though a spacecraft couldn't surive. This statement also had no followup counterarguement; there was no sentence to make me want to change my mind.

It also states in paragraph three,"" On the planets surface, temperatures avergae over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth."" This piece of the paragraph again identifies the risks but now into more detail. There is no followup counterargument, so again this author is making me completely against the idea of sending life to Venus.

It states in paragraph four,""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" This statement is one of the only pros that I have encountered from the author so far. This makes me think that this could be a good idea, especially due to the fact that Venus has some of the same features of earth.

The author then goes on to say,"" imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as out jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At the thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit. But the air pressure would be close to that of se level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This paragraph finally gives a safe solution to exploring Venus in a habitable way. However in the sixth paragraph the author states,"" Therefor, scientists seeking to conduct a throrough mission to understand venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" This statement shows how the trip to Venus would be a waste of time if you cannot get on the surface. There is no point doing this exploration because any human life will not survive if you get too close to the surface.

In conclusion the author did not convinve me that traveling to venus is worthy expidition. The author mainly explained the cons of the study and did not provide too many pros. The author did not support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",1,9020ae63f2ae44ef8806994937a8bbc5
"As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions on this matter. However, I can provide arguments for both sides of the issue.

On one hand, praising positive actions could be an effective approach to teaching. Positive reinforcement is a fundamental concept in behavioral psychology that involves rewarding desirable behaviors to increase their chances of being repeated. By acknowledging and praising a student’s good behavior or good work, the student feels encouraged and motivated to continue doing well. This can lead to a positive cycle of learning, as the student becomes more engaged and invested in the learning process.

For example, let’s say a teacher noticed a student who struggles with math has finally grasped a difficult concept. The teacher could praise the student in front of the class by saying, “Great job, John! You worked really hard to understand this concept, and it paid off! I’m so proud of you!” This positive affirmation could motivate John to continue working hard to understand math and increase his confidence in his abilities.

On the other hand, ignoring negative actions could also be detrimental to a student’s learning. Ignoring negative actions could lead to the student feeling neglected or unimportant. The student may not receive the help or guidance they need to improve their behavior or work. This could lead to frustration, demotivation, and disengagement from the learning process.

For instance, let’s say a student consistently interrupts the class and disrupts the learning of others. If the teacher ignores this behavior and only praises the good behavior of other students, the disruptive student may feel left out and unimportant. They may think that their behavior is acceptable and continue to interrupt the class. This could create a negative cycle of behavior, as the student becomes more disruptive and disconnected from the learning process.

In conclusion, praising positive actions and ignoring negative ones is a heavily debated method of teaching. While positive reinforcement can be a powerful motivator for students, ignoring negative actions could lead to negative consequences. It may be more effective to use a balanced approach that acknowledges both positive and negative behaviors, while also providing guidance and support to help students improve. Ultimately, the best teaching approach varies based on individual students and their unique needs.

"It is an indisputable fact that the human experience would not be complete without literature. Many of us have a strong appreciation for books and the stories they tell, but few of us consider how important they are to our understanding of the world around us. In particular, children's literature serves as an essential building block in helping children develop into well-rounded adults by teaching them life lessons through colorful characters and captivating plot lines. Through these works, young readers learn about diversity, empathy and resilience; all valuable skills necessary to become successful individuals later on in life. One work that stands out from the rest when it comes to educating readers about such topics is Roald Dahl’s “Charlie and The Chocolate Factory” (1964). This classic story follows Charlie Bucket as he wins one of five golden tickets which grants him entry into an incredible chocolate factory owned by eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka. Although this novel has lighthearted moments throughout its journey—such as when Charlie meets bizarre yet lovable Oompa Loompas —it also contains several powerful messages relating to acceptance, kindness, discipline and respect for others regardless of their background or differences. For example, there is a clear distinction between two groups present within each ticket holder: those who display qualities such as generosity or humility while at the same time remaining honest amidst temptations versus those who lack both virtues and subsequently face severe consequences due to their behavior. This concept alone can serve as a lesson for anyone reading this book - no matter what age - reminding them that good character often leads greater rewards than bad ones do. In addition to showcasing positive character traits supported by tangible outcomes , “Charlie And The Chocolate Factory” brings attention towards social issues still relevant today such as poverty and class division among citizens . As seen through Charlie’s family situation , readers gain insight into poverty-stricken communities where basic necessities are scarce despite hardworking citizens doing everything possible in order to make

"The surface of Mars is a great mystery to human kind, but the Face on Mars is just a coincidental human face resembling landform. The Face may resemble a human face, but there are also many other things that humans think are faces. One of these landforms that may look like a face is the face on the moon and even clouds can resemble faces. Therefore I believe that the Face of Mars is just a natural landform.

Although it may appear as a face to many people created by aliens, there has been no scientific proof that aliens exist. It's obvious that the Face on Mars is a peninsula or hill landform that may happen to look like a human face. If there was a peninsula or hill landform on Earth that happened to appear as a face, would everyone jump to the assumption of aliens? Then again there is no scientific evidence that aliens don't exist, but aliens are just made up science fiction creatures that people have come to believe are real.

Therefore the Face on Mars is just a peninsula or hill landform that coincidentally happens to appear as a human face. Just because it happens to look like a humans face and its in outer space people jump to the assumption that aliens are the reason behind the Face on Mars. The entire idea of aliens is just a joke humans made up to scare other humans.

"The impact of technology on art is an interesting and complex topic. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that advances in technology have had a huge effect on the way artists create their work. This essay will explore how technology has changed the creative process for today's artist, as well as its effects on the appreciation and consumption of artwork. One major influence of technology on art is the availability of new digital tools which allow artists to create works faster than ever before. With computer software such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator, users can quickly craft intricate designs with precision accuracy - something that would have taken hours or days to accomplish manually just a few decades ago. This makes it easier for artists to experiment with different ideas and techniques until they find something that resonates with them creatively. It also enables them to produce more high-quality work in shorter periods of time - allowing them much greater latitude when creating pieces at larger scales or incorporating multiple mediums into one project. The advent of social media platforms like Instagram and Pinterest has also dramatically increased opportunities for visibility within the art world; these sites provide easy access points where anyone can showcase their talent and potentially gain recognition among potential buyers or galleries looking to commission new pieces. Additionally, websites like Patreon allow creators to get direct financial support from those who appreciate their work; this could be beneficial for independent artists who don’t have reliable pathways for making money from their creations otherwise. Finally, advances in virtual reality (VR) technology are beginning to change how we consume artwork – instead of just viewing images online we can now experience full immersive environments created by an artist’s vision! VR headsets let us step into richly detailed 3D worlds constructed completely out of code – bringing us closer than ever before towards fully realizing our wildest imaginations through artistic expression! Within this space creatives are free to push boundaries even further by exploring interactive approaches never seen before – such as giving viewers control over certain elements within

"Do you think we should extend our school day? No, I think we shouldn't extend the time because we already get enough learning and our classes are long. I also don't think we should extend the time because we will be getting out of school later. If we we extend the time then we could be very exhausted during the school day. This could also be very difficult for the bus drivers because they will be getting home extremely late and it will be dark when they are driving the kids home back from school.

We get enough time in school already so there is no need to add more time the the school day. We learn enough in every class, and we learn everthing that we need to learn in that hour and a half. We learn what we have to learn and if we add time the the teachers won't really know what to do. I think we understand that they are saying and we understand the concept they are teaching us. The school day would be way longer for elementrary kids. I don't think its fair for elementray because they stay in their classes the entire day . It would be very broring because they are going to be sitting there for eight and a half hour. It would be very broing for them, because they don't get to switch classes like middle and highschool. They should also have some fun during the school day they shouldn't just sit there and high school and middle school at least get to move around while they are switching classes. They really can't do anything after school is done.

If we extend the time in school we will be at school later. Kids will be tired the next day because they wont get home until the evening. They wont pay attention to class because they didn't get enough sleep and they will not be paying close attention to what the teacher is saying because the class it too long. We will also be getting home late. Elementray kids will be getting home around 5:00pm. They won't be able to do many activities after school because they are getting home late. When they get home they will have to eat, shower, and go to sleep because they have school the next day and they deserve some fun. High school kids wake up around 5:00am and they will be at school for eight hours and then they wiil go home and do their homework. They will be tired because they don't get enough sleep and they have to wake up very early. They also can't do activities because of the homework they have and how early they have to wake up and the time they get out of school. They will get home late and they can't do much because they will have to focus on homework and school.

Extending the time could be harder for bus drivers. Bus drivers need enough sleep so that they can drive the students safely to school. Sleep is the most important and you should get at least eight hours of sleep, and that can't be possible for bus drivers because they will get home late. They all need to rest good so that they can be wide awake. If they don't get enough sleep this could lead to crashes. Crashes could happen if it's too dark and the bus drivers can't see outside. Elementray students would be getting out out around 5:00pm and around that time it will start to get dark and it isn't good for bus drivers, because they cant see if they are somewhere very dark. They also won't get to see their family as much anymore and spend time with them. They need to spend time with their family it is important to spend time with them. If they get home around eight then they will get to spend very little time with them. They have to go to sleep early because they need to wake up on time. Crashes aren't good because the parents can sue the county and that will be the countys fault because it was dark outside and maybe the bus driver couldn't really see outside.

I dissagree with adding one and a half hour to the school day. I think seven hours is enough time for a school day and to learn all the materials that we nned to know. What do you think should we add one and a half hour to our school day?         ",1,78670872ebda46008f49e5c8b405dfdf
"Many cities, states, and countries are trying to find solutions to our problem of pollution and smog. Many have established car free days or car free suburbs which have helped to better or environmet.

In Vauban, Germany there is a suburb in which has limited the usage of cars, seventy percent of the families living there do not own cars another fifty seven have sold their car to move there. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" stated by Heidrun Walter a resident and mother of two. This statement shows that by selling or not purchasing a car you can avoid stress however this may not be true for all people. Not owning a car allows us to save money by not having to pay for the car or car insurrance. ""Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"". Limited car usage would lower these numbers to take a step forward in bettering our environment allowing a better future.

As well as car resricted subburbs some cities have other ideas to reduce car usage. Paris had previously installed a plan to have drivers with even numbered license plates to leave their vehicles home and odd numbered plates to leave their vehicles home  the next day ""Congestion was down 60 percent"". This shows that this idea to ban vehicals based on license plates can work, however 4,000 people were fined due to non cooperation. Paris was not the only capitol to try and lower personal vehical usage, Bogota, Colombia for three years has had a day in which cars have been banned only allowing taxis and buses, the goal is to reduce the smog in a capitol city of 7 million. Despite a rainy day most citizens participated in the car free day ""It's a good opportunity to take away and lower air pollution"" stated by Carlos Arturo Plaza. Foregin cities and countries aren't the only ones trying to lower pollution, ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less ang getting fewer licensences as each year goes by."" Although riding a bus or other public transportaion or an alternative to a gas or diesel vehical such as a bicycle may take longer than a car but it has shown to be worth the extra time.

There are pros and cons to limiting the use of gas and diesel vehicals. Many countries and cities are trying to promote car-less suburbs or car free days to help contribute to the reduction of smog and pollution.",1,00744e5b1bb8406b8310ae90c618aac0
"There is no single answer to the question of whether the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Some factors to consider include the cost of the tour, the size of the group, the age of the travelers, and the destination.

One advantage of traveling in a group led by a tour guide is that the guide can provide a wealth of information about the destination. A good guide will have extensive knowledge about the history, culture, and geography of the area, and can share this information with the group. This can make the trip more interesting and informative.

Another advantage of group travel is that it can be cheaper than traveling on your own. When you book a tour, the cost of transportation, lodging, and some meals are often included in the price. This can be a cost-effective way to travel, especially if you are on a budget.

However, there are some disadvantages to traveling in a group. One is that the pace of the trip may be slower than if you were traveling on your own. This can be frustrating if you are eager to see as much of the destination as possible. Another disadvantage is that you may not have as much flexibility as you would if you were traveling on your own. For example, you may be limited in the amount of time you can spend in each location, or you may be required to stick to a rigid itinerary.

In conclusion, there is no single answer to the question of whether the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. It depends on individual factors such as the cost of the tour, the size of the group, and the age of the travelers. However, group travel can be a fun, affordable, and informative way to travel.

"Did you know that there has been an ongoing debate between Nasa and the society? The debate is about whether or not the imprint on mars's platform that appears to be a face, was created by a natural cause or by an alien. I had done some scientific study on the situation myself, being that I am a scientist and I believe that the imprint was indeed made naturally.

some eveidence to back up my claim would be that in paragraph 12 of the article i used as a part of my scientific study is that what the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. This reminds another scientist named garvin, of the middle butte in idaho. A middle butte is a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars. This is proof that the imprint was made naturally and not by an alien because lava domes are made naturally which is what the face on mars is.

Taking classes online offers a unique and possibly more advantageous learning experience to students. From the convenience of their own home, students are able to work on their studies at their own pace and often with more flexibility in their schedules. This is especially beneficial when it comes to those with other commitments or responsibilities. However, taking classes online also comes with some cautionary notes. Remote learning does not always offer the opportunity to meet and collaborate with other students, and students must be completely self-motivated and organized in order to be successful online. It is important to speak with a school counselor or educational advisor to fully understand the pros and cons of taking classes online, as well as taking a test to assess one's readiness for remote learning. That said, if you choose to pursue online classes, there are a plethora of potential rewards. Taking classes from home could allow more opportunities for free time, consistent concentration, and the ability to work on coursework at one's own pace. Additionally, many students can even make gains in terms of grades by taking their classes online. It is up to each student to do their research, assess their skills, and make a conscious decision about whether taking classes online is the best choice for them.",0,0261cb4e2f9e4b228380bafd24ddbd71
"What is Facial Action Coding system? A Facial Action Coding System is computers that will help identify human emotions. For example say the person is 85 percent happy 7 percent disgusted and 4 percent fearful and 0 percent angry. Some new computer softaware can recognize emotions. I am for the value of using the technology to read students emotional expressions.

The process beigns when the computer constructs a 3 D computer model of the face all 44 major muscles in the model must move helps human muscle. For example your '' frontailis pars lateralis muslce above your eyes raises your eyebrows when you are suprised your orbicaularis oris around your moth shows your lips to show anger.

Onther reason is facial excpressions for each emotion are universal says Dr. Huang. Second using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements. Last it bring a smile to your face while its shows just much the computer can do.

This is the reason why i think the FACS is a great idea because it can help kids tell when they are sad or happy. Helps them shows there true feelings. THE END!!!!",1,a8535d2d208042cb9c8b8802209971c4
"A university education can do both preparing students for employment and other functions. It is widely believed that the primary purpose of university education is to prepare students for their future careers. However, the university experience can also offer students other opportunities and advantages.

One of the main advantages of university education is that it can help students to develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. These skills are essential in any career, but they are also useful in everyday life. For example, critical thinking can help you to analyse and understand complex issues, to make sound decisions, and to solve problems effectively.

In addition, university education can also help students to develop their personal and social skills. For example, they can learn how to communicate effectively with people from different backgrounds, to work effectively in teams, and to manage their time and resources effectively. These skills are also essential in any career.

Finally, university education can also offer students the opportunity to learn about other cultures and to develop a global perspective. This is increasingly important in a world where business is increasingly international and where people from different cultures need to work together.

In conclusion, university education can prepare students for their future careers, but it can also offer them other advantages. It is therefore important to consider the university experience as a whole, rather than just the employment opportunities it offers.

"Should America really go out without the common everyday use of cars as transportation? Just think; which is more convenient? For some people, walking may do it... but there would be much difficulty without the utilization of cars during this modern era.

In

German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it is claimed that in VAUBAN, Germany, residents have given up their use of cars.

""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have no change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America.

Cars are, without a doubt the fastest means of transportation from street-to-highway; and very convenient in more ways than one. Sure, it may be alright to walk whenever you may feel to, but how will you be able to get to work faster if your job is many miles away? It surely will tire you out by then.

In

Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog, forces have banned cars from common usage and ordered the residents to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine.

""Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters.""

This lets me know that many people disagree with the idea of not being able to have their own cars within their reach. In certain weather conditions, such as the cold, harsh winter, just the thought of traveling on a bicycle or walking does not do any good for us! And in the summer when the humidity conditions are so high and hot, we would be too exhausted to move a muscle and refuse to walk any more than what is the seven-eleven down the block from us. In addition, you can carry many personal belongings in the comfort of your car -- which is much simpler than having to stand on your legs or tire them out from excessive bicycle-riding, along with having to deal with five bags of groceries filling your hands. When convenience comes to us, it's a good idea not to reject that opportunity.

In

The End of Car Culture

(also by Elisabeth Rosenthal) it is discussed that President Obama agrees with the abomination of car transportation. The opposing argument may say,

""

Observations show that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009...""

But I can certainly disagree and state that not only is transpotation through cars a great way to get around, but it's also entertaining. In the car, you can listen to the radio, whether its news or listening to music on the way back home from work, (which is sometimes stressful.) Atleast you know you'll be sitting in your car comfortably, while listening to music. Also, traffic jams may be problematic; but for some people, the overpopulation of many people being crammed up into your personal space in the outside air may be a real pain. Even excessive crowdedness that occurs on the bus may very well be a daily struggle for people who dislike crowds.

Cars will only continue to grow in a positive way in the future, and I believe that is something our past has brought to us, and only for the good of it. So why not use it? Driving is better than walking/bike riding. We shouldn't be working our way backward, but looking to our future, and that calls for the better and more advanced technology that the people have brought to us, that our nation shall continue only to improve--and cars would be one of them.",1,53d046510fab4445a0194cd117291cf2

Dear Senator [Senator’s Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong endorsement towards retaining the Electoral College system for the presidential election of the United States. The founding fathers established the Electoral College as a democratic method of selecting the president (Posner), a setup that for centuries has ensured the ability of electors to act as proxy voters (Office of the Federal Register). As a [state] resident, I believe this vital institution promotes national coherence, protects diverse interests, and enhances the weight of my individual vote.

First, the Electoral College promotes a balanced distribution of political influence across the United States. Due to the requirement of a trans-regional appeal, candidates' appeal must span across different regions to garner sufficient electoral votes (Posner). This compels them to address the needs and concerns of various constituencies rather than focusing solely on population-dense urban areas or politically homogeneous regions.

Second, the Electoral College system naturally safeguards against the potential cataclysms of an election. As Posner outlined, the winner-take-all system and the allocation of electoral votes across states often curtails disputes over popular votes. The system reduces uncertainties and provides a clearer verdict, thus ensuring the stability of our political landscape.

While critics argue that the Electoral College is outdated and undemocratic (Plumer), I believe these arguments overlook the unique democracy of the United States. The population disparity among states adds complexity to a direct popular vote system, and it could risk marginalizing less populous regions. Moreover, the possibility of ""faithless"" electors or electoral ties is an exceptionally rare occurrence, and these potential issues should not be seen as systemic flaws (Plumer).

Additionally, the emphasis on ""swing states"" prompts voters in these regions to be more discerning and informed, encouraging an engaged electorate (Posner). The beauty of our electoral process is that it allows voters to participate in the shaping of our country, regardless of whether their candidate of choice wins. 

In conclusion, the Electoral College is an essential component of our unique democratic process that preserves the republic's character and history. I urge you to continue in the defense of the system, ensuring the preservation of our signal democratic institution. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

"There is no denying the fact that education plays an important role in an individual's personal and professional growth. However, the question of whether education is a life-long process or not is a topic of debate. In my opinion, education is a continuous process that lasts throughout one's life, and I support this view for several reasons.

Firstly, education does not stop after we leave school or university. Learning is a never-ending process, and we continue to gain knowledge and acquire new skills throughout our lives. For instance, we may learn a new language, take up a new hobby, or attend workshops or conferences to stay updated with the latest trends in our field of work. These experiences help us broaden our horizons and keep our minds active and engaged.

Secondly, we live in a constantly evolving world where new technologies, ideas, and discoveries emerge every day. To keep pace with these changes, it is essential to continue learning and adapting. For example, a doctor who stopped learning after completing medical school would be unable to provide the best care to their patients. Similarly, a software developer who does not keep up with the latest programming languages and tools would become obsolete in the job market.

Moreover, education is not just about acquiring knowledge and skills but also about personal development. By learning new things, we discover new perspectives and ways of thinking, which can help us become better individuals. For instance, learning about different cultures and societies can broaden our understanding of the world and make us more tolerant and accepting of others.

In conclusion, education is a life-long process that is essential for personal and professional growth. We should always be open to new learning opportunities and strive to improve ourselves in every aspect of our lives. As the saying goes, ""learning is a treasure that will follow it's owner everywhere.""

"Why stride to hear others ideas?

What is so beneficial?

When asking for advice, seeking multiple opinions helps to make better choices.

It is helpful to hear from different people for many reasons, such as experience, personal backgrounds, and different personal views.

Over time, people will have experienced thousands of different problems, which can be helpful opinions to receive.

It is thought that traits like wisdom, earned over time, are more likely to give better advice.

My grandfather would always love to tell stories from his past about how he overcame his struggles, and at the time I didn't notice, he was telling me life lessons.

Although someone who is an older age might have experienced more struggle in their life, age doesn't always matter.

Simple things like not recommending an activity at a vacation spot, because you didn't enjoy the experience is helpful to hear. People with different backgrounds that came from different homes can carry important ideas as well.

Being born into different homes, and living with different families help to shape who a person is or their opinions.

Depending greatly on your family, you naturally pick up new knowledge just through sharing a living space, or spending time with them.

Having a larger family or family members that share their opinions with you, can open someone's personal spectrum.

But when some family may widen ones views, others can make them more limited.

Possibly not having two parental figures around at home, or being an only child may affect how someone sees the world or a topic.

Because there are endless opinions and outcomes in many situations, it is helpful to hear many views.

Like taking a survey, there could always be a majority answer, but opinions could also be split.

When trying to do something as little as buying a new product or brand, looking at many customer reviews can help you to see what other people thought of the product.

Reading their opinions, maybe different from your initial ones, you could realize that the product wasn't good for your use, or that your ideas are supported.

No people are the same, each with a little or a large range in common, leading to the use of multiple views.

Seeking others opinions widens how you might see a problem, thinking about things in new ways.

Hearing new or forgotten opinions from people with different views, different ages, and coming from different backgrounds, can all be morphed together to conclude your final opinion. Making it always the best decision to gather multiple opinions.",1,d24641c8be034238bc017768475b331d
"Dear state senator ,

Despite some of the risky things that can come along with Electoral College voting ,voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election .Some people therfore think it is useful and some on the other hand think that it is unfair and that it should be changed .

Fortuatntly though one thing that a Electoral College can promise you is a certainty of outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. It happened in 2000 but it is less likely than a dispute over the poppular vote . For exmaple in 2012's election with Obama and Romney , Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner -take-all basis , even a very slight plurality in a state creates a big elecoral - vote victory .

Moving right along , the Electoral college also can aviod Run - Off elections . The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast . For instnace , Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes while winning a majority in the electoral college . That situation then creates pressure which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral college. Therefore ,there would be  a clear winner .",1,30eb7fab0de84126b9c4a5b4785b9bb9
"I agree that the successful people will try to do new things rather than doing what they alredy know. If this not possible there may not any new inventions for defence ourseleves in any case for eg; medicines, computers, hydrogen bombs ets., etc.

I do not agree with this statement because I think that there are many things that can be done that have not been invented yet. For example, there is a lot of work being done in the field of nanotechnology. There are also many other fields of science and technology that are still in their early stages of research and development. Therefore, it would be very difficult for a person to be successful in all of these fields at the same time.

What is the most important thing that you have learned in your life so far? I have learnt that it is important to have a positive attitude and to believe in yourself and in what you are trying to achieve. It is also important not to give up when things don't work out the way you want them to.

"The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. But is this advcanced system valuable or particularly necessary? In my opinion, although this coding system is brilliant, there is not a need for it in the classroom.

The fact that I live in a time where computers could calculate my mood and or my emotions is nothing short of amazing. But, this coding system doesnt benefit the consumer at all. In paragraph six, D'Alto gives an example of a computer analyzing your mood as you come across an ad. So, if you come across happy or smiling the computer will continue to display like minded ads but, if your computer sees that you are frowing upon seeing the ad it will direct you to different ads. Now this is great for the compant who sells whatever is in the ad, they get to literally profit by this technology. But what does it do for the one viewing ads? Nothing.

Another example given in paragaph six is in a classroom setting. Dr. Haing states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then, it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". I'm not saying that this technology cannot do what it claims but what it does is utterly uneeded in a classroom setting. If a student is becoming confused about a certain topic they should raise their hand and ask a teacher (even online run courses always ave a teacher there to supervise). They should seek out a teacher guidance because, at least in my school district. cirriculum cannot be altered.

My district is made up of is five different highschools. All five teach the same exact math, english, and science curriculum. So, the computer would not even be permitted to change my lesson even if I was confused. So whats so helpful about a notification appearing on my screen saying thay I am about 63% confused? the answer is simply, its not.

In conclusion, although this software sounds very talented in what it is capable of achieving, is not useful in the classroom. This specific technology would quite honeslty serve me and my fellow classmates no use at all. What this software can do is what almost any human can achieve with sight and cognitive skills. Give me valuable software that will give me alternate youtube videos or websites to hellp me if im confused not software that just tells me im confused.",1,949f7a35e89642738b3806d67c18ca88
"Limiting car usage is a good idea. Limiting cars usage it a wonderful idea for many reasons. most people have the ability to live there life without cars, this would help cut back on pollution, and for most people it would be cheaper. Although some people may see this as a impossible way of living some of us do not.

To begin, people can live without cars people have done it before us and eventually people will do it after us. As shown in source 1 these people in Vauban, Germany have given up a life of cars for a simpler much quiter life in the suburbs. Life in this city has been condensed down into a one square mile area where people are able to go on with there everyday lives without having to get into a car to go somewhere. Life in this city is does not go completely without cars if these people need to leave the city they can simply walk to their very own parking space in the parking garage right on the outskirts of the city. these people have the ability to keep there cars but they have to buy a parking space when they buy there house you also generally wouldnt need your car unless you were going on a long drive that required you to leave the city. There is also the fact that there will be a day soon when we run oout of fossil fuels and what is a fossil fuel? gas. there will soon enough be a day where we dont have any gas and we will not be able to drive cars everywhere that we want.

Next, this would be one of the most effective ways to cut back on pollution. as shown in the 2nd source paris was struggling with a very bad polution problem that they needed to deal with. Paris was having the same sort of problem that beijing, china is having and beijing is the most poluted city in the world. so they banned all the cars that ended in a even number on monday and a odd number on tuesday. Just doing this for one day cut the amount of pollution in half. Imagine our worldwide polllution levels if driving was limited. The second largest form of pollution is cars so limmiting driving could even drop cars a few ranks back. Every part of getting to fossil fuels that fuel our cars is more and more pollution. gas is a very large pollutant and it causes alot of problems for our nation and one day there will be no more gas.

Furthermore, limiting driving would almost be cheaper for the people as talked about in source 4 less and less people have been getting there liscenses and driving cars because it isnt needed as much anymore. there are more ways of public transit that people are taking advantage of such as the mans son who takes the Bay Area Rapid Transit instead of driving his car. some might say that taking these other forms of transportation might take longer and yes they might be right but they are also much cheeper instead of having to pay a large amount of money to first, buy a car and then, buy gas. which the gas prices only seem to be going up lately. They have the ability to buy cheep tickets for the ride on the train or maybe a bus. As i spoke about earlier we will one day run out of fossil fuels. Gas is a fossil fuel and leading up to the time where we wont have gas anymore the gas will just keep getting more and more expensive because the less gas we have in our community the more that it will cost. also the more that people will want it one day most of us will not have the money to drive cars not because of the cost of the car but because of the cost of the gas.

Coming to a end, there are many other ways to travel other than buy a vehichle and some may be easier for you cheeper for you or better for the environment so why keep on hurting the environment when you could simply make the world a better place by just not driving a car. there are many reasons to limit driving but we could easily do it because people can live without cars, it would help the environment and cut back on pollution, it would also be much cheeper.",1,9dd809e40a4d4e7fa34fdcd8790f08fe
"When people ask people for advice they often ask more than one person for their opinion. They ask them because it is helpful to have more than one opinion on something .To fully make sure they are 100 percent about what they are doing .And that it is the correct choice .It is always helpful to get more than one opinion because it helps to get someone elses point of view, to make sure your doing the right thing ,and its just always helpful to get advice on things.

One reason it is helpful to ask for more than opinion when you are making a decision is because it is always helpful to have someone elses opinion from a different perspective. That is helpful because if you are making a decision and you ask someone for their advice about it they might see it from a different way and give you a better decision to make. For example when I am making a choice I usually always ask my friends because people see and think things different ways .That is why I always ask my friends or family or family because due to experience it is always helpful in the end .Doing this will usually come out with a better outcome.

Another great reason to ask for opinions from multiple people is because you want to make sure you are doing the right thing .You might have chosen to do something not so good but then you ask other people for their opinion and they say well you know thats not really the best idea so instead you choose the right thing to do .Which is very helpful because peoples advice may lead you in the right way. For an example one time I was going to make a decision that wasnt the best but then I asked my best friend what she thought and she told it was not a good idea and I shouldnt do it. Which is why it is always helpful to ask for peoples advice on things before doing it because it might be a bad idea.

Finally another reason it is helpful to get more than one opinion on something is simple is that it just helpful to hear another persons opinion .Due to experience people tend to make better choices if they hear advice from other people. People tend to do the right thing when others agree with them .For example if someone has made a decision to do something and then they ask someone for their advice about it and they agree. That person is going to have a confidence boost about what he or she is doing because others agree.

In conclusion when in doubt ask it out meaning if you are not sure about something or even if you are .You should always ask for other peoples advice about something. For a better outcome or just to know you have made the correct choice. Because a bunch of different people will give you different answers about your scenario. So therefore you should always ask for advice to be sure .",1,af694263fb534f7a806b812e77ace620
"Philosopher, Physical, and humanitarian Albert Schweitzer say that example is not the main thing in fluencing others, actually being a example can not be a good thing to influence others becuase first you need to start doing the right thing on your own before you decide to be a example or influence others and that's mean that you need to do everything perfect when that's means that it is hard to do it.

They say that example is not the main thing in fluencing others becuase being a example can be stressfull. For example, they can be stressfull on trying to do everything perfect to do not do wrong things to influence others and they have to be responsible with what they do to not do mistakes so that they can influences others and they feel that it is a very stressfull responsability of influcing others.

However, they believe that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others people and being a good example makes they feel responsible to others and they feel that they have the responsability to do the right way in their own so that they can be a good example to others.

In reality, they say that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others people because they feel that they have the responsibility with their own behavior so they can do the right way in their own first to influence others. They also say the having respect to others is a good example of our behaviors and being humildity is also a nice examples that we can teach or influenes to others. They believed that being honest with anyone is also a good example of our behaviors. For example, they believe that being responsible with their own behavior is a good example to start doing the right way and to influence others because the responsability gives to others respect. They say the being on time in any meeting makes they responsible with their own behavior and gives other a good example of responsability. They say that responsability is a example of our own behavior and can be something that they can learn with the time and needs practice. I believe that being honest with others is a good example by start setting our own example behaviors. I also believe that humildity is a good example of our behavior because the humildity and that responsability is something that I can learn from others with their own actions or their behaviors. For example, I learned how to be responsible with my things for my mom and my dad because they teaches me how to do it and that this need practice too and I also they teaches me that being a example with our own behavior makes you humildity and teaches you how to valore what you already has and accept what

I don't have.

In conclusion, they want to argue that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people because being a good example by your own behavior teaches they how to do the things rights, so they can influence others by doing and taking the right way and also teach how to be responsible, honest, and being respect to others.",1,96e5e544b7e341bd9cb4825a3a2f6032
"Advertisements are an integral part of our daily lives. They are everywhere, from billboards to television screens, and they are designed to sell us products. While some advertisements are honest and straightforward, most of them tend to exaggerate the benefits of the product they are promoting. In my opinion, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

One of the main reasons why advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits of a product is because their primary goal is to sell. Advertisers want to make their products look as appealing as possible to potential customers. They use a variety of techniques, such as catchy slogans, flashy graphics, and emotional appeals, to grab people's attention and persuade them to buy their products. However, this often leads to a distortion of reality, as the actual benefits of the product may not be as significant as they are portrayed in the advertisement.

Another reason why advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits of a product is because they often focus on the product's positive aspects while ignoring it's negative ones. For example, an advertisement for a weight loss supplement may tout it's ability to help people shed pounds quickly, but it may not mention the potential side effects or the fact that the supplement may not be effective for everyone. By emphasizing only the positive aspects of the product, advertisers create an unrealistic expectation in the minds of consumers.

Moreover, advertisements often use celebrities or influencers to endorse their products, which can create a false sense of credibility. Consumers may be more likely to trust the product if they see a famous person using or endorsing it. However, this does not necessarily mean that the product is effective or worth the price. Celebrities are often paid to endorse products, and their opinions may not be based on their personal experience with the product.

In conclusion, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Advertisers use a variety of techniques to grab people's attention and persuade them to buy their products, but this often leads to a distortion of reality. Consumers need to be aware of the potential pitfalls of advertising and do their own research before making a purchase. By being informed and skeptical, we can make better choices and avoid falling for the hype of advertisements.

"There is no doubt that advertisements often make products seem much better than they really are. However, I believe that this is not always the case. Sometimes, advertisements accurately reflect the quality of a product.

For example, consider a pair of shoes that are being advertised. If the shoes are of poor quality, the advertisement will likely reflect that. The advertisement might show a person wearing the shoes and then falling down. Alternatively, the advertisement might show the shoes falling apart after being worn for a short time.

In contrast, if the shoes are of good quality, the advertisement might show a person wearing the shoes and then dancing or running. The advertisement might also show the shoes being worn for a long time without any problems.

This example illustrates that not all advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Sometimes, the advertisements accurately reflect the quality of the product.

"If you don't do something beyond what you already mastered, you will never grow; From my past experiences i strongly agree. In life things aren't easily handed to you if you want something bad enough you have to work hard for it if you wanna become a better version of yourself. Most people around the world look up to certain successful people and wish to become just like them with all the money, cars, and fame like the famous rapper "" Nba Youngboy "" which has made himself known through his music rapping about his life and difficult obstacles he's had to go through to make it where he is now.

Growing in life and being successful isn't something that's going to happen over night it takes time and patience. With every task comes a difficult obstacle that'll try to put you down and make you wanna give up and people usually tend to give up easily.

If you need help then usually more then one person's opinion would help. But say you give someone an example then of your friend's or someone close,that you trust they would give there honesty. Another reason is if you have more then one person you trust then they wouldn't lie neither would they tell. Usually if you ask more then one person the same question, you might get the same answers or some what close to the same answers. To add on to that would sum everything down into one. Now say if you ask someone for advice they could be lying or just not know, so that's why if you ask more then one person for advice that would help. But usually if you need help or advice ask an adult cause they've more then likely have had the same questions as you. Plus if you want to ask someone for advice or need help and no one knows you can just use the internet more than likely they have an answer. Also if you need an example of something and your friend's reply does't sound right, just look it up on Google or any other website. Google or any other website would give you a more reasonable and more understanding answer. Now not everything on the internet is true but you can still ask more then1 people or go on more then one website too see if there example or advice is true. But to sum everything up, if you need help, or advice, or an example, or have a question to always ask more then one person cause you never know what they are telling you could be completely true.",1,0a89c3ef14e0485cbaac470a0e9f36ff
"Using this new form of technology called the Facial Action Coding System ,which is being used to identify human emotions, could be a good contibution to society. But, in my opinion technology that is used to read our emotional expressions would not be that valuable because there are not a lot of things we could use it for and we are capable of expressing ans sensing our feelings on our own.

If we were going to start using this technology, what exactly would we use it for?

There are not many actual reasons that we would need it. In the article they bring up how this technology could be used to tell if a politician or celebrity was lying or telling the truth. Which could be important because we would not want to be supporting someone who lies to everyone to get them to be on their side about something. Other than that this technolgy does not actually hold a lot of value.

Also, I do not think that we need technology to help tell us how we feel. We are all capable of knowing how we feel. If something makes us happy then we will smile and if something made us sad then we might cry. So, having something to tell us how we feel is kind of a waste of time and money which could be used on more important things that we need as a society.

In conclusion, this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System used to identify our human emotion does not hold any value. It may have a good contribution to some people who are not able to sense or express their feelings. But I do not think it is important enough to be used on a daily basis for certain people.",1,b708e7bd6ee24ab08f2cd7ee0e82678d
"Do you think first impressions are impossible to change ? In my opinion a first impression on someone or something change be changed, because you never know what the stereotype of the thing can be.

When you first meet someone your first impression on the person can be one thing but you never know what the person could have. For example you see a fat guy or female and you can be quick to judge them but you don't know anything about there life, till when you talk to them and get to know their true story that they medical conditions on why they are the way the appear and look like. You could meet a Hispanic, For example you might thing they came to US illegally, but you don't really know that some Hispanic are actually born in the united states and are legal citizens. when you see a Asian person you may think there smart because of your first impression stereotype, but not all Asian are actually smart and appear to who you really think they are.

Next is the type of thing you purchase or are going to purchase, it can look nice and be expensive but you dont know the background story on the item or thing you are going to purchase. For example when you want to purchase a car or house, you can be looking at it on the internet and like it a lot but once you buy it you start noticing strange thing. If it is the car you realize the its starting to give you a lot of problems that you are constantly taking money out you'r pocket to try to fix it to your expectations and what were your first impression on the car being nice and reliable. Second a house you're impression where ""oh wow this is a really nice house"", so you go on and purchase it the you start realizing that the house was making wired noises at night while you are trying to sleep, Then one day you go online and contact the landowner or research the history of the house and realize the house is haunted because the original owner past away their.

A first impression is just a stereotype or judgment that you think of someone or something before not know the background story on it. Before you go and be quick to judge some based on their looks talk to the person see why they are really the way they look before making fun of them of talk about them because everyone in this world isnt perfect and everything has a story behind it.

"Living in a small town can be both a blessing and a curse. Growing up in rural America, I never fully appreciated the advantages of living in tight-knit community until I moved away to college. Although there are plenty of drawbacks associated with living in a small town, it's clear that there are many benefits as well; like feeling safe, having close friendships and experiencing nature on a daily basis. Safety is one major advantage of life in smaller communities. Everyone knows everyone else which means crime is much lower than urban areas because people look out for each other and take pride their hometowns. As residents we have peace of mind knowing our neighbors will look out for us when necessary—not something you find everywhere!. The close-knit relationships between small towns' citizens also contributes to the sense safety since most people know each other by name or face alone. It’s not uncommon to walk into the local corner store or diner and exchange friendly banter with familiar faces who live nearby; making it easier to get help from others should an emergency arise. People create deep bonds over time that add value to our lives beyond security alone – these connections often last for years even if one moves away from home. On top of feeling secure, there are numerous social benefits associated with living in a small town too! Friendships develop quickly since your peers tend to be more accessible than they would be otherwise due largely to the fact that everyone sticks together despite limited resources available around them such as entertainment venues or recreational activities outside school hours (unlike those found in metropolitan areas). Group outings happen regularly which further cements these important relationships -thanksgiving dinners at church basements become birthday parties down at Main Street ice cream parlors! The overall atmosphere creates an environment where younger generations can build meaningful connections without worrying about competing against waves of strangers like happens elsewhere so frequently nowadays. .

"The benefits of starting a vegetable garden are many and varied. Not only is it an enjoyable hobby, but it also provides a practical way to grow healthy, nutritious food in your own backyard. From the initial planning stages through to harvesting delicious produce, there is much satisfaction to be gained from tending a well-maintained vegetable patch. When setting out your vegetable garden you can consider factors such as sunlight exposure, soil type and drainage; all of which will affect how successful your gardening endeavor will be. The physical exercise involved with planting, weeding and watering can help build strength and improve overall health; plus being outdoors often has great mental wellbeing benefits too! As vegetables need consistent care throughout their life cycle – from sowing seeds or planting seedlings right through to harvest - this gives us the opportunity for regular contact with nature that transient city-dwellers so often miss out on. In terms of financial savings, growing vegetables at home undoubtedly saves money compared to buying them at the supermarket (or even farmers’ market). Furthermore by growing organic vegetables yourself you know exactly what goes into producing them meaning no nasty chemicals or additives end up in our food! Producing fresh fruit and veg also means less carbon emissions since fewer resources have been used for transportation purposes than if we had bought commercially grown produce elsewhere. For beginner gardeners who wish to gain more knowledge about safe gardening practices or learn more about particular crops commonly grown in home gardens then there are plenty of online courses available providing useful tips based on scientific research related specifically to sustainable horticultural practices. Alternatively attending one of these classes locally could provide hands-on experience while giving us access to mentors with years of gardening under their belt; they really do have invaluable insights that prove invaluable when starting off on our own journey into cultivating edibles at home!. Overall creating a vegetable garden is an incredibly rewarding activity that brings multiple physical, mental and economic benefits not just for ourselves but also for future

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the matter of the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States. After thoroughly examining the arguments from both sides, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be preserved for the following reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winner of the electoral vote usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the likelihood of a disputed outcome is lower compared to a direct popular vote. Stability and legitimacy are crucial in any democratic process, and the Electoral College provides this by avoiding prolonged election disputes.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the idea of having a president who represents all regions of the country, not just specific areas with high population density. As Judge Posner argues, a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. By requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College guarantees that the president will consider the interests and concerns of all regions, preventing regional disenfranchisement.

Additionally, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states, which results in a more engaged and informed electorate. The system incentivizes candidates to pay attention to states that can swing either way, leading to more thoughtful and informed voters. This ensures that the election outcome is not solely determined by a few heavily populated states, but rather by a wide range of states with diverse priorities and perspectives.

Moreover, the Electoral College gives weight to the political balance of large states. As mentioned by Judge Posner, large states receive more attention from presidential candidates due to their greater number of electoral votes. This mechanism balances the influence of small and large states, enabling candidates to address the concerns of both densely populated urban areas and less populated rural areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which simplifies and streamlines the presidential election process. The Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, preventing prolonged periods of uncertainty or the need for additional voting rounds. By avoiding run-off elections, the system promotes efficiency and maintains the democratic principles of representative government.

While some argue that the winner-take-all system of the Electoral College can lead to candidates ignoring states they have no chance of winning, it is important to note that candidates have limited campaign resources and must prioritize areas where they have the greatest opportunity for success. The Electoral College ensures that candidates focus on competitive states, giving a fair chance for all voices to be heard.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides certainty, representation, engagement, balance, and efficiency in the presidential election process. It guarantees a clear outcome, ensures presidential representation for all regions, promotes thoughtful voter participation, balances the interests of small and large states, and prevents the need for run-off elections. For these reasons, I urge you to consider the benefits of the Electoral College and to support its continuation.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",0,1440cba9838846d08a55a051e22c7a0c
"Drivers should not be able to use their phones at all behind a wheel. Today's technology has become a big impact on everyone life. The most used technology of them all is the cell phone. This device has any and everyone hypnotized which makes it very dangerous. Cellphones is a deadly device to me personally because people that on our cellphones do not pay attention to what goes on around them. That's why it's important for us to not have them while driving.

Studies have shown that at least 6% of accidents have been caused by somebody using a cellphone. It seems that not only are drinking and driving dangerous, but using a cellphone behind the wheel is very dangerous. People in this generation believe that it's always dangerous if you text and drive. Just being on your phone period can be a dangerous situation for anybody, not just you. People believe that since you are not texting on the phone that it should be okay to be on the phone, I believe you shouldn't be on it period!

If we put our phones up and pay attention, a lot of accidents could prevent. We could have saved many lives. Cellphones are a huge distraction believe it or not, especially in today's society. It seems that the cellphone has become everyone's priority. That's why we cannot put them down for more than five minutes. Even talking on your phone is worse than texting, but texting is what people talk about the most. We should be talking about people being on their phones period .Just being on your phone can be more dangerous than anything.

See, driving a vehicle is already dangerous enough because you can easily end your or someone else's life. You need all of your attention on the road and what's going on around, so you can be aware. A cellphone will take your attention away from most of things around you. Texting while driving can take away from reaction time. If you're on your phone, it will give less time to react to a situation.

In conclusion, I believe drivers should not be allowed to drive while they are on a cellphone.

Cellphone are a huge distraction and with this distraction people can be injured or killed from using their phone. Instead of talking about texting while driving we should talk about us not using a cellular device at all when you're behind a wheel. We should try to enforce it more so people's lives can be save, and people don't have to get injured.",1,26eb4aa00ddc4961b7b5917d42ec214e

For many students, staying two extra hours in school is a challenge. Having an extra two hours tacked onto the regular school day puts an undue burden on students who may already be lacking in energy or time. Having a full day of school can take a toll on students’ physical and mental energy, and asking them to stay two additional hours with limited resources can be overwhelming. 

For instance, students who are already feeling overwhelmed by academic tasks may reach a breaking point when faced with the option of staying for an additional two hours of school. While it may not seem like much time, it can be the tipping point between feeling exhausted and feeling overwhelmed. Moreover, staying an extra two hours in school can also make it more difficult for those with after-school commitments to honor outside obligations or just spend time with family. 

The lack of time and energy can also have a psychological effect on students. If they are not able to stay the extra two hours, they may feel a sense of guilt or disappointment. It can be emotionally challenging for students to leave school in the middle of a lesson and feel like they are letting both themselves and the teacher down. 

In conclusion, staying an extra two hours in school can be an incredibly stressful experience for students who may already be feeling overwhelmed or struggling to manage their time and energy. Not being able to stay for those extra two hours can have both physical and psychological consequences. It’s important to remember that everyone copes in different ways and we must take into account students’ individual needs before making decisions about the length of the school day.",0,f4eb8652dfb54828ae700ed0cdbb458e

In a world of instant digital connection and interaction, it is more difficult than ever to remain true to oneself. With each new advancement in technology, social norms and cultural expectations shift alongside it, forcing us to constantly adjust to the influences around us. Social media can be especially challenging, as users are often encouraged to present the ""best"" version of themselves to the world, at the cost of authentically expressing their true feelings and beliefs. It can become tiresome to constantly keep up with the trends, and comparing ourselves to our peers can begin to affect our self-confidence and well-being. 

This need to appear perfect and accepted by society can have lasting effects on our self-perception and can impede our journey to discovering our true identity. It is essential to take time away from the chaos of the world and to remember to breathe, reflect, and to embrace being our genuine selves. The key to facing our difficulties head-on and staying centred during this time of great change is to remember that, despite the shifting of norms, it’s completely okay to be ourselves.",0,3b8106a44ea14ee6b6a81a5bab452b14
"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky and human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Venus's knickname is sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" mainly because Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth has proved a very challenging place to examine closely.

It is also called the ""Evening Star"" because Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. On Venus, the temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than on Earth.

These conditions are far more extreme than anything human would encounter on Earth.

It is not suprising that the temperature average is so high given the fact that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. So basically, if you walk on Venus you will get burns.

Studying Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky because it is simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.

Yes, Venus has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely, but although it is not clear due to the fact that 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, it is still simple to see from the distant, safe vantage point.

No spacecraft survived for more than a few hours because of the carbon dioxide blanketing clouds of Venus.

The clouds of Venus most likely explains why not a single spacecraft torched down on Venus for more than three decades. Venus's atmosphere at night is not affected by carbon dioxide of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. This is exactly why studying Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky is simple for an amateur stargazer to spot.

Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

Venus has value because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself just like intimidating endeavors does as well.

Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, it should only be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

This helps to strive to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value.

So, because our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts, intimidating endeavors should only be expanded to meet the imagination and innovation of the travel.

So, because Venus is simple to see from the distant and because our travels should be expanded, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it only presents a small amount of dangers.

So, If Venus was more of a dangerous planet to explore, walk on, and study, would this be a planet that everyone would be interested to study and afraid to walk on to explore?",1,d37f2d7546fa486f8b0d50b8e505e9bb
"Dear, senator

I belive the electoral college was a usefull tool in the past ,but is now an out date system that should be changed. If we continue to use this system we aren't really giving the people a fair chance to vote for who they want. For example in California a more democrtic state republicans may be lessen the incentive to vote knowing that there vote will not have an effect. This rasise another issue, which is not everybody is voting and it is not all a right but a prevlige among US citicens every where. The elctoral college was evective in the past because we did not have the technologe to count all the votes from each state, but now we do so we can only go by the popular vote.

The popular vote is more effective and I'm not the only one who thinks so over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Al Gore thanks to the electoral college won the popular vot but lost the elctoral, how is it that some one could win more votes from most voters ,but still lose? The answer is the elctoral college, the reason is that you are not voting as a indiviual person but as a state. This brings me back to California and how republicans votes don't count because the state voted democrat.

Though the electors should do there job and vote with the state they could always defy the will of the people. In 1960 segregationist nearly succeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would op-pose John F. Kennedy. So please take into consideration that your vote may not have an effect on the election if we don't change the system.",1,f0b2bd12bf8b44979a6043099adb21ac
"I think that drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones while operating a vehicle. It is very dangerous because it distracts the driver and takes their attention away from the road. When someone is using a cell phone, they are not paying attention to the traffic lights, other cars on the road, or pedestrians. This can lead to accidents and injuries, and even death.

Furthermore, using a cell phone while driving is against the law in many places. It is considered a traffic violation and can result in hefty fines. If drivers are caught using their cell phones, they should be penalized severely. This will deter others from breaking the law and using their phones while driving.

In conclusion, I believe that using cell phones while driving is a very risky behavior. It puts the driver and other people on the road in danger. Therefore, it should be strictly prohibited, and people should be made aware of the dangers of using cell phones while driving.",0,030ed54f68c14db2bde0b53865e2d78d
"In a society where things are always changing and schedules are always busy, cars and other personal motor vehicles have become a necessity. It seems as if cars have become a necessary mean for survival, rendering as important as something imparative like oxygen or water. Many families even have multiple cars in order to get to where the need to go. Even though cars have been so convienient and beneficial for people all over the world, there are some factors of cars that produce a negative effect. By eliminating or largly reducing car usage, the world would be more safe, more eco-friendly, and save the precious natural gases that the Earth provides.

For years people have been driving, and while most do it safetly, some do it recklessly and do not abide by the rules, sometimes leading to fatal outcomes. Reckless driving, careless driving, and driving under the influence has become one of the leading causes of death among young people, making many very skeptical or cautious about driving. Millions of people are lost each year in car accidents, leaving behind family members and loved ones to grieve in their place. If cars were to be elimated from the equation, all of these deaths could easily be avoided. By walking, riding bicycles, taking the bus or subway, or even a trolly or ferry, there will be an ensured reduction of accidents and an increase in safety and peace of mind.

In additon to increased safety, there would also be a significant reduction in the emissons of greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases and smog have been polluting the atmosphere especially since the coming about of cars. It says in source four that transportation produces half of America's carbon emission. If car usage were to be limited or eliminated, there would be a noticable and significant decrease in the amount of carbon emissions in the air. Similarly, source one states that, "" Passanger cars are responsible for 12 pecent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" If cars were to be ridden of, there would be much less green house gas poluting the atmosphere, therefore creating a cleaner environment and a brighter and longer future for the generations to come.

Similarly, the removal of cars from the world would mean the preservation of nonrenewable resources. Since cars run on gasoline, diesel, and other natural gases, the resources are being burned up faster than they can replenish themselves. There are other things that rely on the natural gases to work, cars included. If cars were to be eliminated, and not use the gases at the rapid rate that they do, there would be a huge reduction in the usage for fossil fuels, therefore preserving the remaining resources and only using them when mandatory. This would allow the natural gases to slowly increase and be able for use in the future.

In conclusion, the limitations of car usage would make a significant change in the way the world runs, however there would be many positive outcomes to it. Not only would it ensure a brighter, longer, and more promising future for the coming generations, but it would also relieve stress and worrying and grant peace of mind to many. Although there is no way to take back the damage already done to the Earth, this would greatly reduce the potential damage that could be done, and protect the future. It would provide oppurtunities for a a cleaner atmosphere, safer life, living in harmony with the ecosystem, and a chance to respect and protect the Earth we live on.",1,3be6d0a29475431da0c7e170a68d6fbd
"What if we always knew what everyone was feeling? It sounds like it would be great if we could always detect one another's facial expressions. However, every human being has a different individuality which sets them apart from everyone else. That individuality is what makes that person unique, and can effect the way that a technological device percieves them. Everyone thinks differently, learn in different ways, and expierence different things.

While it seems like reading the expressions of one another may be a good thing, you cannot depend on the technology when you do not even know how accurate the technology is. By the way that the technology is described, it seems that the process reads one's emotions based off 6 basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. However, humans feel much more than these 6 emotions. We can feel emotions such as confusion, passion, and boredom. If the technology is basing some one's emotions off those 6 universal emotions, the data cannot be completely accurate because those emotioins do not work together to create boredom or even confusion. The feeling of confusion is a comeplelty different emotion, it is not affected or made up of one's happiness or anger. A person cannot detect confusion simply from reading only 6 universal emotions.

""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'""(D'Alto). While that would be particularly useful in an academic field, it may not work as well as anticipated. Every human being is unique and different, so therefore, they can become confused for different reasons or get bored of different things. What one student may find boring, another may find quite interesting. If that lesson plan changes for the student who is becoming disegaged in the lesson, it will affect the other student who use to find the lesson interesting, it may cause that student to then become confused or disinterested. That is a flaw with technology, it cannot benefit everyone equally because every human being is uniquely different and can be affected in different ways.

Many tend to hide their true feelings simply because they do not want others to know their true emotions. To read students' emotions in that way is an invasion of one's privacy. When people are sad, they hide that feeling because they either do not want to think about what is making them sad, or becuase they do not want to make the people around them sad as well. Reading the facial expressions of people, especially those who conceal their emotions, is similar to reading one's thoughts, which invades their private thoughts and emotions. When some one is hiding their emotions, that is their private feeling and should not be shared nor invaded unless with permission granted by that person.

All-in-all, the technology cannot be proven to be accurate since it can only read 6 emotions and many people expirence a much more vast variety of emotions, than the simple 6 universal emotions. Including the fact that everyone is unique in the way that htye think and project emotions and thoughts differently. The technology also cannot change the plans for students effectively since a change for one student could harm another student academically. And finally, to read one's emotions, including the emotions that they conceal would be invading their privacy. People hide their emotions for a reason, and those emotions should be kept to them, they should not be read because they are considered one's personal thoughts.",1,dd6ad8ce298144d7b8ff12d51dd44de2
"I think seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. When getting multiple opinions it can help you make a better decision because you can see all sides of the situation. Another reason it is important is that you can have the positives and the negatives of what could happen. The last reason is that you could change your view or opinion on the situation.

When making a big or little decision it is always good to have multiple points of views. Instead of just having one or two, you could have five or six and have more thought go into your decision. One good thing about this is that you could have people that don't think or act the same as you look at the situation and give you advice on what to do. If you get multiple opinions you will probably talk to a few people who have had to make a tough decision before. They could help you figure it out or tell you what they did when they were in the same situation. What I think is the most important reason is, is that you are able to explore people that don't think the sames as you opinions and your decision will most likely become easier to make once you have heard other peoples advice.

When getting different peoples advice it could sometimes change how you look and think about your decision. One good thing that comes out of multiple peoples advice is that you could realize the decision you are about to make might not be as good as you thought it was. You could also change how you look at the decision and realize that there could be better options where you would be happier. The last reason is that you might be on the verge of making that decision just because you think it would be better for you even though it is not. If you talk to a couple of people about it they could change your mind and you would be grateful you didn't follow through after all.

The last reason that it is a good idea to get multiple opinions to make a better choice is that you can get the pros and cons of a situation. One good reason to get the positives and negatives is because you will be able to compare if the good things about this decision out weigh the bad things. Another thing is that you decide if the risk is worth the reward. The final reason is that by comparing the goods and bads you might realize that you could be affected in a bad way more than you could be affected in a good way.

In conclusion, when asking for advice more opinions is always better than less when getting advice. Getting multiple opinions is good because you have more ways to think about the situation, you can look at the pros and cons and what could go wrong, and the last reason is you could change your view of the situation if other people tell you or convince you its not a good idea.",1,9932109f57c345049c84580b4701ca07

"Animals are a source of food and clothing, but they should also be treated as pets. Animlas provide humans with many advantages, and thus they deserve to be both protected and respected.

First and foremost, animals are sources of food. Taking care of animals allows us to have a steady source of food. Many different animals provide us with meat, eggs, and dairy products. This is more humane and efficient than hunting animals, which is why many people choose to raise domestic animals. Furthermore, animal hide and feathers can also be used to make clothing. For example, cowhide is used to make leather jackets and coats, and goose down is used to make jackets and blankets. In this way, animals contribute to providing us with food and clothing.

However, animals should also be treated as pets. Taking care of animals can lead to many positive changes in a person’s life. For example, having a pet can help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. Pets can also help people bond and build relationships with others. Finally, having a pet teaches people to be more responsible and caring. Taking care of an animal teaches a person compassion and empathy and can even help improve self-esteem.

In conclusion, animals should be treated as both sources of food and clothing and as pets. Taking care of animals can provide us with many benefits and help us become better people. Animals should always be respected, and we should take care of them the same way we would take care of ourselves.

"It is often said that young people enjoy life more than older people do. While it is true that youth is a time of great energy and enthusiasm, I disagree with this statement. I believe that the enjoyment of life is not limited to any particular age group, but rather is a matter of personal perspective and attitude.

To begin with, young people often face a great deal of pressure and uncertainty. They are often trying to figure out their place in the world, and this can be a stressful and overwhelming experience. They may be struggling to find a job, or to make a decision about their future. They may also be dealing with the pressures of school, or the expectations of their parents. All of these things can make life difficult for young people and can make it hard for them to enjoy life.

On the other hand, older people often have more stability and security in their lives. They may have a job they enjoy, or a family they are close to. They may have a good understanding of who they are and what they want out of life. This can give them a sense of peace and contentment that can be hard to find in youth.

Furthermore, older people often have more wisdom and experience than young people. They have seen and done more in life, and this can give them a greater appreciation for the little things. They may be more likely to take time to enjoy the beauty of nature, or to appreciate the simple pleasures of life. They may also be more likely to take time to appreciate the people in their lives, and to savor the moments they spend with them.

Finally, older people often have more time to enjoy life. They may have retired from their job, or may have more free time than they did when they were younger. This can give them the opportunity to pursue hobbies or activities they enjoy, or to travel and explore the world.

In conclusion, I believe that the enjoyment of life is not limited to any particular age group. While young people often have a great deal of energy and enthusiasm, older people often have more wisdom and experience, as well as more time to enjoy life. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide how to make the most of their life, regardless of their age.

"Phones and Driving

Nowadays in modern society there are many ways to interfere with safe driving conditions. More specifically something that a numerous amount of people us in their daily lives. This object is a cell/smart phone and it can determine life or death. There is a time and place for these devices but the road is not one of them. Yet, like every problem there is a solution and the solution to this problem can be fixed by heavy law enforcement.

The majority of people own or at least have seen a phone. Those devices have become more common over the years. These devices can become addictive and can lead to bad choices. For example, if you are driving and you get a text most people's reaction is to pick up the phone and look at the message. Even if you think it is harmless you could be in potential danger.

There are many dangers on the road already. Cell phones usage only makes worsens the fact that there are risks on the road. For safe driving conditions you have to keep in mind that if you use your phone while driving that text could be your last. Help out your community and become a safer driver.

When people ignore the fact that they are not just endangering themselves but also drivers. That means the law enforcement needs to step in and take action to correct it. That would be the most effective way to simmer down this issue of cell phone usage during a vehicle operation. No texting and driving laws will definitely get into people's head.

In the end you can make a difference. You can help by not answering that text or call while driving. There are many dangers on the road like new drivers and weather conditions so take that into consideration. You don't want to be the individual to cause a fatal accident and end your life or somebody else's. All in all don't de selfish and consider others and put an end to it.",1,809be3371cbb4490b6f5beb1332fce59
"Dear Senator,

I don't think that we should keep the Electoral College because I truly believe that as the people of our country, we should have the freedom to vote for whom we think best fits the role of our president. I'll tell you why.

I have read this passage about three times in a row and I've gotten a better understanding of how the Electoral College works. I can understand an opinion that thinks the Electoral College is great and I'm sure it's a little less complicated and such but it's not quite fair to certain people in small states, etc. There are people who don't even see a point in voting now because they know that their vote will most likely not matter. As stated in

Source 3: In Defense of the Eletoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, paragraph 23,

""

It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state--Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing thier vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..

""

I strongly disagree with people in our country feeling this way. We are together as a country. Everyone's votes should matter. We are all here as one. People will have less and less interest in voting and we will go nowhere. I believe that the people should fully understand the process and not only that. Understand who is about to become president. In the country that we the people live in. Know this persons values, are they worthy? Know the lengths that they will go for our people. People should not feel that because they're in a small state, their vote doesn't matter. It should not be this way. I do believe that voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election but don't you think that everyone should be involved and that everyone should be informed or even have an opinion on what is about to happen? I feel that there are some people who are not fully understanding the system. As said in

Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong, paragraph 10,

""

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.

""

Do the people even know who these electors are? Who picks them anyways? I understand that it depends on the state but do they know that? I also read that voters can not always control whom their electors vote for. Also that sometimes, voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate. This is what I mean by people not fully understanding.

This is just my opinion followed by some evidence and explanation. Maybe you could see from my point of view and anyone who has a similar one.

Sincerely, PROPER_NAME",1,5ae067be0cf647fbb4560667e69b1694
"The ability to lead effectively and manipulate public opinion is a skill that few can master, but it is especially crucial in the realm of politics. Whether it is a small-scale issue or a national policy, the effective political leader must be able to navigate the often-turbulent waters of public opinion and find a balance between principle and compromise. While there are times when a leader must be willing to abandon principle for the sake of compromise, I disagree that this is always the case.

The most effective political leaders are those who can understand and empathize with the needs and desires of their constituents. It is not enough to simply push one’s own ideals, regardless of public opinion. A successful leader must be able to engage with the public and work to meet their needs while still upholding their own principles. This is often a difficult balancing act, but it is essential for effective leadership.

Take the example of Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi is widely regarded as an effective and successful leader, and much of this success can be attributed to his ability to remain steadfast in his own principles while also finding a common ground with the people he was trying to lead. He was passionate about his ideas and principles, but he was also able to temper his zeal with a willingness to compromise. For example, while he was opposed to British rule in India, he was also willing to work with the British and meet them halfway in order to find a peaceful solution.

At the same time, there are times when a leader must be willing to abandon principle for the sake of compromise. This is especially true when there is a lack of agreement among the public. In such cases, it is often necessary for the leader to abandon their own principles in order to establish a common ground and move forward. For example, in the United States, the two main political parties often disagree on major issues such as healthcare and immigration. When there is no consensus among the public, leaders must be willing to set aside their own ideals and find a solution that works for everyone.

In conclusion, effective political leaders must be able to navigate public opinion and find a balance between principle and compromise. This is often a difficult task, but it is essential for a successful leader. While there are times when a leader must be willing to abandon principle for the sake of compromise, this should not be done blindly. Rather, it'should be done as part of a larger strategy to find a common ground and move forward. Ultimately, the most effective political leaders are those who can understand and empathize with their constituents while still remaining true to their own principles.

"Having technology to read a student's emotional expressions is outstanding. The technology can see how your feeling, if your feeling sick, sad, happy, angry, and surprised. It can help councelors see how you are feeling with problems you may have or just how your feeling that day or the week in general. If students used this new idea, it would be helpful for guidance councelors as well for helping students with problems with school/homework or dealing with drama.

This technology can help prevent more teenagers/children committing suicide. This is especially important because everyday teenagers commit suicide due to the fact that they are getting bullied at school, feeling sad, have depression issues, and have suicidal thoughts or actions. The technology can help prevent this because it detects if a person or student is sad, happy, depressed, mad, or having suicidal thoughts. Everyday parents and everyone in this world lose their children/teenagers from suicide. If students all around the United States of America stopped bullying each other we wouldn't have so many teens committing suicide every year.

The technology can also help with elderly people who have short term memory loss or dementcia. It can help the elder person and the nurses or relatives if they are in a nursing home because it helps the nurses see how that elderly person is feeling and how their emotional state is doing on that day. It could possibly help with the elderly with dementcia and their memory and possibly help them regain some memories they once had but forgot.

This emotional state detecting technology can change the way we deal with things. This new idea can help so many teenagers out with problems and adults as well. The technology can be a game changer and a very helpful resource or tool too many people in the United States of America and all over the world. Technology has advanced so much in the past decade but this new technology can save millions or thousands of lives every year from comitting suicide or with problems people may have all around the world.",1,a26d43555e504b4e8cc15b04d44eefab
"Greetings Mr. State Senator, Looking over the Electoral College, there has come to be a few interesting details. Yes, the process is beautifully thought out but as we look at it deeper it has its flaws. The founding fathers have given us the Electoral College, which anarchist are very unappreciative veiwing it as a nondemocratic way to vote.

If the Electoral College system goes, then Americans can have their full Constitutional rights. Using this process voters are not voting for the electors of their choice, voters are voting on higher qualified voters to vote for the electors. The whole process is a violator of the amendment entitled to voting. Having this maze of voting for voters, what if a voter confuses of who the electors is voting for so their vote isint actually going to the candidate of their choice. In 1960 before the election of John F. Kennedy, the segregationists of the Louisiana legislator came very close to replacing all of the Democratic electorss with electorss who opposed John F. Kennedy. So all the voters in favor of JFK. will be voting against him and all the Electoral College votes would be going to the other candidate.

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defences are wrong , ""At the most basic level, the electorsal college is unfair to voters."" Plumer makes a very valid point beacuse of the size of states. The electorsal College's number of representatives are as big as their states population. So if all of the representatives in Alaska vote on the Republican candidate, and most of the people in California vote for the Democratic candidate, the Electoral College vote in California overules the vote in Alaska.

The Electoral College can make some voters not want to vote, usually because of their state size their vote doesnt count as much. Many voters in larger states refuse to vote because their vote wont really change the Electoral Collage's vote. The voters don't have total control over an electors, so the whole election crisis could happen again.

In conclusion, the Electoral College may have worked when the colonies were small and the votes counted, but today the modern society doesnt appreciate its lack of Constitutional rights. All we ask is for our right to vote to be given to us, so we can take part in our government.",1,96cd83c646ff42fdb02505d160a3f10e

Working in a group offers the advantage of increased efficiency and faster completion of tasks when compared to working alone. With multiple brains working together and communicating ideas, tasks can be completed in a shorter amount of time than when relying on a single individual. This makes group work ideal for problem-solving and brainstorming. Additionally, working in a group can create an efficient an effective environment that produces thoughtful results.

On the other hand, when completing simple tasks or those that require little collaboration, working alone can be beneficial. Working solo allows a person to work at their own pace with no distractions, allowing for more focused and uninterrupted work. Additionally, working alone can help to develop greater self-discipline and productivity, as there can be a significant lack of accountability when working in a group.

The communication aspect of working in a group versus working alone is an important aspect to consider. Working in a group encourages more open communication and better understanding between the members. This helps to ensure that all ideas are discussed and considered in order to reach the best possible solution. Conversely, working alone can lead to misunderstanding and can limit the exchange of ideas and opinions.

In conclusion, it is important to consider the pros and cons of both working in a group and alone in order to determine the best method of completing tasks. Each brings its own unique advantages and disadvantages, so the decision as to which is more beneficial should be based on the specific situation and task at hand.",0,687bc0ad06fb4bae816d8fc731328fb1
"Yes, facts are important for students to learn, but they are not the only thing that should be considered when studying a topic. Ideas and concepts should also be considered when learning a subject. By understanding both, students can better grasped the meaning and implications of the information they are learning. This can help them develop a better understanding of the topic at hand and be better equipped to discuss it with others.

For example, when studying the history of the United States, it is important to know the different moments that led to the founding of the country. However, it is also important to understand the different factors that influenced the creation of the country. Concepts like slavery, independence, and democracy all had a large impact on the early years of the United States. By understanding these factors, students can better understand the complicated history of the country.

Similarly, when studying the history of the world, it is important to understand the different empires that have ruled over different parts of the world. However, it is also important to understand the different movements that have tried to enlighten people about the true nature of the world. Concepts like communism and democracy have had a huge impact on the world, and by understanding these movements, students can better understand the current state of the world.

By understanding both ideas and concepts, students can better understand the information they are learning and be better equipped to discuss it with others. In addition, understanding ideas and concepts can help students better understand the information they are reading, watching, or hearing. By understanding these things, students can better understand the story they are being told and be better prepared to discuss it with classmates.

"Were you ever in a situation where you didn't know what to do, so you asked for someone else's advice and or opinion? If so, did you seek the opinions of multiple people or just one person, and do you think seeking the opinions of multiple people could help someone make a better choice? I believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you get to know about different peoples experiences, you know about more possible outcomes, and you gain more knowledge about the whole situation.

Asking multiple people for their opinions or advice will benefit you more than just asking one person. I think asking more people about a decision you're making will help you make a better choice because maybe they were all in the same situation as you, and they could all offer advice that will help you in different ways. Different people will give you different pieces of advice based on their personal experiences, and it may not be the same for everyone. You will also be able to hear about more peoples experience's, which should help you be more prepared to make a choice. Before I started middle school, I asked my older cousins and friends about which classes they recommend. I listened to multiple peoples opinions, and decided which classes I should take. I couldn't take all the classes everyone recommended, so I took the classes that more than one person recommended because they had similar experience's that were all good.

Listening to different peoples opinions and experiences will inform you about more possible outcomes. Everyone that offers you advice could tell you something totally different, and that just tells you about how many possible outcomes you should be prepared for. Before a big test I ask my friends that have already taken it about how it went, and if they think I should prepare more by studying a certain topic. If my friends scores surprise me then I can infer that the test was either very hard or very easy. Asking more than one friend will also help me make a better choice on whether I should study a certain topic or not.

Seeking someone else's opinion will also help you gain more knowledge on things you might not know much about, but seeking multiple people's opinions will help you gain even more knowledge than one person alone could provide you. Having all that extra knowledge should definitely help someone make a better choice. Before my cousin went to college she asked many people on what major they recommended for her. Many people told her about their majors', and how it went for them. Since she asked so many people for their opinions it helped her learn more about different majors, so she could make a better choice about what major would be best for her.

It just makes more sense to me for people to seek the opinions of multiple people to help them make a better decision. I believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you get to know about different peoples experiences, you know about more possible outcomes, and you gain more knowledge about the whole situation. It also never hurts to ask people for their opinion, and if you want to make the best choice possible it's best to ask different people for their advice.",1,64088ee97ce8403a8e1cd7259cf563aa

"The Value and Necessity of the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system and to urge you to continue to uphold its importance in our presidential elections. While some argue for a shift towards a direct national popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democratic process for several reasons.

First and foremost, the Electoral College provides certainty in election outcomes, as highlighted by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College."" Because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their popular vote percentage, disputes over the outcome are less likely compared to a popular vote system. This stability is essential in maintaining public trust in the election process.

Moreover, the Electoral College ensures that every region of our diverse nation has a voice in the presidential election. As Judge Posner points out, no region has enough electoral votes to singlehandedly elect a president. This requirement for trans-regional appeal encourages candidates to campaign and address a wide array of regional concerns, rather than focusing solely on the needs of highly populated areas. It fosters a sense of inclusivity and prevents regional favoritism.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its promotion of swing states. In swing states, which offer a more balanced distribution of voters, candidates are compelled to focus their campaign efforts to win over these crucial swing voters. This practice benefits all voters, as those in swing states tend to be more engaged, informed, and thoughtful in their decision-making. By empowering these voters, we ensure that the most considered individuals have a say in electing our president.

Furthermore, the Electoral College safeguards the influence of larger states. Due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, large states can lose some political weight. However, the Electoral College rectifies this issue by giving more attention to states with larger populations. As Judge Posner highlights, a narrow victory in a large state like Florida results in a significant number of electoral votes, whereas a similar margin in a smaller state like Wyoming would yield fewer electoral votes. This balances the influence of big and small states, ensuring a fair distribution of power.

Lastly, the Electoral College offers a solution to potential run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, which could complicate the presidential election process, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. It streamlines the election process and avoids the need for time-consuming and costly run-offs.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate is unlikely to win, it is important to note that voter turnout is not solely contingent on the possibility of influencing the outcome. As evidenced by the high turnout in the 2012 election, citizens engage in the electoral process to express their political preferences and be part of shaping our democracy.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a cornerstone of our democratic system. It ensures certainty in election results, prevents regional favoritism, encourages candidates to cater to swing states, balances the influence of larger and smaller states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. I urge you to defend the Electoral College and reject any efforts to replace it with a direct national popular vote.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust in your commitment to safeguarding our democratic institutions and upholding the principles upon which our nation was founded. If you require any further information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]",0,f32882129e314b5fb3a6766dee646c85
"The Electorial College is something in the United States that needs to be replaced. It is an irrational system that takes the people's power to vote away from them. The system has flaws that leave the possibility of disaster open to happen. It takes the power to choose the goverment officials from the people, and gives it to a group of people who can vote either way. Why would we keep this?

The Electorial College is a way to choose the Presidential canidate who wins the election. It involves a slate of electors (according to Source 2) who cast their votes in. The people in each state vote for the winning electors of that state. The electors pledge to a canidate and thats what people vote for. Once the people choose a winning elector group they go to Congress and cast their votes in for who they want, and that person then gets so many votes. The problem is that the electors aren't required to vote for who they said they would, so if the elector suddenly decided to change his mind after he or she won, the people's votes are basically invalidated and a different elector gets the votes. This effectively removes the people from the equation in who gets elected. All an elector would have to do is win over the people, then he or she could just change their minds and cast a different vote than what they said they were going to do. The people who vote don't even vote for the Presidential canidate in this system, they vote for a bunch of electors that they hope will vote for what they said.

This is not an irrational, unrealized fear. It has actually happened before. According to Source 3, in the 2000 election, Al Gore had a majority of popular votes, but less electorial votes, so he lost to Bush. This isn't even the first time it has happened, it has happened previous times throughout U.S. history. This is a clear example of how flawwed the Electorial College system. Between the possibility of the people's votes not counting for anything, and that they don't even actually vote for their preffered canidate, this system needs to be replaced.

Some may argue that the chance of an elector not casting his or her vote that he pledged to is very slim. Why would you even be ok with taking such a chance? It's better to be one-hundred percent sure of what will happen instead of ninety-five percent. Also, since most states in the U.S. award electorial votes by a winner-takes-all basis (according to Source 3), if one side of the votes wins, even by a slim margin, they get all the votes. This seems unfair, since if they won by a slim margin at least some of the state thinks it should be a different vote. It would make more sense if the states awarded both sides of the vote if it was a close win for one side or the other, but they would award the true winner with more votes than the narrow loser.

Another problem with the E.C. system is that states that are largely of one belief ( Republican or Democrat ect. ) have no real reason to pay attention to the opposite side of the canidacy. Since the state would be largely one thing or the other, it is irrelivant if thirty percent of the state votes one way if seventy percent of the state votes the other, since the landslide victory style of electorial vote giving is present in most states. This also means that states that are biased and small states get almost no exposure from the opposite side of the canidacy because they know they have almost no chance of winning their votes. This seems to force the voters to choose one canidate's electors because they don't know enough about the other.

In conclusion, the Electorial College needs to be replaced with a more fair, balanced system. It has the potential to allow the electors to defy the will of the people who voted them in, invalidating the people's votes and making them pointless. It also has candates only focusing their ads and visits on the states with more votes and the states biased towards their party. Finally, it has almost all the states have a landslide ""winner-takes_all"" style of awarding electorial votes. This means if one side of electors only wins by a slim margin, the other side gets nothing, even though since they lost by a small number they clearly have a sizeable amount of voters for them. The Electorial College needs to be removed before someone takes advantage of it's serious flaws and takes the votes of the people and makes them useless.",1,dcf1fc584eaa4726bdd29e07e13e04ee
"Nowadays, with gas prices skyrocketing, along with prices of new cars, it is logical for any person to invest their time in the use of public transportation or carpooling. As you can see in this passage, many countries have already begun to take a stand to protect our planet by limiting car usage to reduce the amount of gas emissions. America as a country needs to find a way to get involved as well.

In Vauban, a city in Germany almost all homeowners have given up their cars and turned to bicycling and walking to get where they need to go. Paris upholds a fine where people who have even-numbered license plates are allowed to drive on Monday's and odd-numbered plates on the next day. If a motorist did not abide by this rule they were forced to pay a $31 fine. Also, in Bogota, Colombia, the nations capital participate in an annual ""Day Without Cars"". Only buses and taxis were permitted and violaters faced $25 fines.

In America, transportation is the second largest source of gas emission, us as a country to take a stand to change that and protect our planet. With the rise in new technologies of things like cellphones and smartphones, cellphones now have car-pooling apps where it's as easy as clicking abutton to find a ride to work without driving your own car. It's also beneficial to you because you don't have to spend your money on gas, tolls and other fees. It's very simple to catch a ride on a bus or train as well, its cost efficient and good for the enviroment. Getting rid of your car altogether is beneficial in more ways than one. You don't have to worry about the cost to maintain your cost for things like repairs and insurance. And of course, you dont have to spend as much as $200 a month on gas.

Countries around the world have begun to use their resources to limit the amount of car usage. In just simple ways like carpooling or taking a bus or a train, each person can help in making a change to our world to save our atmosphere from pollution.",1,3d14a055a0164eb78040d82ac1278d34
"Is there any advantages of limiting car usage? Whether it's for the environment or even your health, there are some advatages that overall can help you. Lets be honest, cars aren't cheap and i don't really see them getting any cheaper but walking from point A to point B is free. It's kind of like killing two birds with one stone, by walking you save the environment from the gas you would be burning and you're saving money at the same time.

Limiting or even completly getting rid of driving can help you become a happier or even tense free person. Driving a vehicle, escpecially on a congested highway or road can create road rage causing you to become more stressful and aggrivated. In a suburb in Germany, residents there are giving up their cars, something they have never done before. They seem to be working efficiently without their cars, still being able to go to the store and work. It seems that they like this way of life better, stress free and no worrys of getting stuck in traffic. Like what Heidrun Walter explained in source one, she said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" People are so infactuated with the thought of driving and cars but they don't realize that driving all the time is effecting your health. Personally, I think it's some of the reason as to why there is so much obesity in this world.

Not only is driving all the time bad for your health but it's also bad for the environment. Paris had a problem with there being so much smog, that they actually had to enforce a partial ban from driving. The partial ban was working, it was said in source 2 that after five days of intensifying smog, congestion went down 60 percent in the capitol of France. The partial ban worked with trying to clear out the smog to help the environment so well that the French party rescind the ban for odd numbered plates on tuesday's. Source 3 explained that in Columbia they were going on there third year of cars being banned except for buses and taxis. Just like in Germany people seemed to being adjusting and liking the idea of no cars on the roadway. A business man named Carlos Arturo Plaza, said that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" referring to Columbias third year of banning cars.

Even if you just have to go right down the street, people hop in there cars and go, when in fact you can just walk. An official of Transportation for America,David Goldberg, expressed about how depended we are on vehicles. He said ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" And change is what seems to be exactly happening. In source 4 it was said that there seemed to be a decline in America's love affair with their vehicles. According to Doug Short, who is apart of an investment research comapany said that ""When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter."" Maybe people are starting to realize that you don't necessarily need to drive and that it's more of previlge then a must.",1,552dfabe9d5f4467be0cf31bed019de1
"Nowadays, electronic dictionaries (E-dictionaries) have been increasingly popular among students. However, teachers think that the overuse of E-dictionaries might have more disadvantages than advantages for English learning. For example, like the use of calculator affecting the skill of calculating, reliance on E-dictionaries may lead to the deteriorating of our spelling ability. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. Write an essay of roughly 300 words.

I agree that the overuse of E-dictionaries might have more disadvantages than advantages for English learning. The main reason is that it might lead to the deteriorating of our spelling ability.

When we use E-dictionaries, we can easily find the correct spelling of a word. However, we might not remember how to spell the word correctly. For example, if we want to spell the word ""restaurant"", we can just type in the first few letters and the E-dictionary will show us the correct spelling. However, if we want to spell the word without using an E-dictionary, we might not be able to spell it correctly.

Another reason why the overuse of E-dictionaries might have more disadvantages than advantages for English learning is that it might make us lazy. For example, if we want to know the meaning of a word, we can just type in the word and the E-dictionary will show us the meaning. However, if we want to know the meaning of a word without using an E-dictionary, we might have to look up the word in a dictionary. This might take more time, but it will help us to learn more about the word.

In conclusion, the overuse of E-dictionaries might have more disadvantages than advantages for English learning.

"First impressions are not ""almost impossible to change"". They can be difficult to change, but they aren't almost impossible to change because there are ways that can help you change your first impression. A thing about first impression is to question yourself on is ""how can I change my own first impression?""

A lot of people say it's almost impossible to change your own first impression, but what they don't realize is that they aren't thinking hard enough to comprehend to understand why they aren't almost impossible to change, so they instead just don't even try and use more of their cognitive ability. What's important about first impressions is having to say something that will impress others.

When you use more of your cognitive ability, then you'll be able to come up with better first impressions. Once you're able to come up with a better first impression; you'll find it easier easier than what other people said based on their opinion. In conclusion, first impressions are a lot easier to change when you think about how you'll change your first impression and when you come up with a better one, but it takes time to develop

"The author does not support his idea well. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" the author never really gives us a good reason to explore and investigate Venus. The author mainly supports his idea with the fact that Venus may have been like Earth a long time ago, but it is not really necessary to learn about Venus.

In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" the author supports his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by comparing it to Earth and how it has many Earth-like features, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" paragraph 4. And even though this may have been true this is not nessacary. If we do somehow figure out a way to study Venus, what would we do with that information, it's just useless information.

The author gives us some information about Venus in paragraph 3, ""temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" from this description we know that Venus has extreme conditions, and that it is inhospitable for humans, paragraph 4, ""our sister planet is so inhospitable"". If human cannot inhabit Venus what would be the purpose of spending a lot of money in order to obtain information for our curiosity.

In the article the author spends more time talking about how we would be able to explore Venus than why we should explore Venus. Out of 8 paragraphs the author gives us 2 paragraphs on why we should explore Venus, in paragrpah 2 he tells us that it is one of the closest planets to us. In paragraph 4 he tells us that astronomers are curious about Venus because it is so alike to Earth. Then in paragraphs 5, 6, and 7 he talks about NASA how they will go about exploring Venus, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape."" instead of just giving us more than 2 reasons on why we should spend our money and time to do something pointless.

The author did not support his ideas well. In the article he wrote more on how we would get to explore Venus rather than giving us more than two reasons on why we should explore Venus. In the article he gives us one big reason why we shouldn't try to explore, we can't inhabit Venus because of the extreme environment. And if we can't really do anything with that planet why bother trying to explore it.",1,fd87666974bd44ad845f644284e52239
"I think the author supports the idea well because i would think it would be dangerous going to see venus , but that is just on what i read in this passasge. Some evidence that i saw in this passage of how Venus would be dangerous is that 97% of venus is covered in carbon dioxcide and it ca melt a submarine that goes in our deepest oceans. Also every other spacecraft that landed on Venus only survied a couple of hours.

My conclusion is that as much as us humans try to get up and personal with Venus it will never happend because of how dangerous it is.

An explantion of the evidence is that Venus is to risky for astroughnaughts to study it. Really the only I say this that Venuses surface is the hottest out of all the planets. Venuses surface tempature averages 800 degress Fahrenheit. Alson the atomspheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we are used to here on Earth.",1,6d143ed0d82e4c97b7dfc0b3b5e3c73c
"Working with a group has more benefits then working alone because with a group you can all help each other and learn new things, also so people can be more social and you can get the work done faster and aso there can be some pressure . When you work alone it can get very boring and you may need help with something but also if you are working alone you can work at your own pace. With a group you may be pressure to finish something quicker but your teamates can help you with that. When someone is in a group they can act silly at times and give the teacher or the boss a headache but, when they focus they can get work done faster. Working with a group is not just for the work, it is for people to be social and so people can see how they act around other's. You can learn new things with other people that you did not already know or you can teach them something but at some point the whole group teaches everyone somehting new.

Working in a group you would probaly be pressured to stop being foolish and get your part done but if you have nice teamates then someone can help you with your part. Some people, perfer to work alone because they do not like to be pressured for no reason but in some ocasions those people are the one's to turn in late work or has incorrect information. In a group they correct you if you did not do something right and hellp you out if you ask for help and someone can help you becuase that's what a group is for to help each other learn new things. If a due date is coming up there can be so much pressure because maybe you have not even done your part or you are just lazy to do it some your teamates start to get mad at you and you do not know what to do.

Learning new things can be fun with a group because you might not be shy to ask questions so you learn new things and maybe someone else from your group learn that same thing as you. If the group learn's something new then they can use that thing in the future when they work alone or with a different group. Helping each other is one of the easiest way to get done with something but working alone you may take longer because you have to search up things and some times they do not know where to start.

Teachers put students in a group to see how they act around each other like if they act goofy or if they do not have self control. When working with a group there has to be self control because if the group is just being goofy then they would not get work done and they can get a bad grade and not work together in that class ever again. The teachers see how the students act and they see who should be with who and who should not be with someone. Working alone the teachers know that it will be quite and they would not know how the students act with friends around or a group.

Working together is way better then working alone because you become more social and not so much of a shy person. A group can also help you focus and have a good time all at once, also they can hep with having a good grade in that class because they helped you a lot. Students learn new things when they working with people and they might not be so shy. Working in a group has more benefits then working alone because working alone you have to do everything on your own and with a group they can all help.",1,198b3eb8337842da809bbe8a70a3f940
"Dear Mr. Senator, Freedom to vote for authority figures in America had been an ideal image of government all across the world. However, is our privilege to vote really honest and are the results of elections really in our hands like we think they are? The Electoral College System undoubtedly should be abolished because Americans have the right to have full control over who is elected President and, although some may believe that Electoral Colleges avoid the occurrence of a runoff election, runoff elections may be avoided with much more reasonable methods.

Clearly, election should be determined by popular vote, and not the Electoral College because Americans earned their right to have full control over the representatives in their government. According to Source 2, ""state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and... those electors could always defy the will of the people."" The defenders could be completely indifferent about the voters choices, or situations where swing states are borderline one party or another, and the Electoral College allows a limited selection of people to make the final decision of millions Source 1. The ballots that we vote in don't even effect the results of the election. It is as if these elections are trying to allude citizens from the fact that the only votes that contribute to the adoption of a new president are the electoral votes. Why bother letting us vote for a president, if only the defenders get to make the decisions?

Unquestionably, the Electoral College is not a sound system for presidential election in the United States. In Source 3, Posner states that when there is an unclear plurality in the results of an election, the Electoral College makes it much simpler and more efficient by reducing the number of voters, eliminating the inconvenience factor. This statement appears as a faulty reasoning to have an Electoral College because it is absurd to remove americans right to vote. Maybe, rather than restricting our rights, the result of a runoff election could be resolved by an Electoral College, but the initial vote should be made only by the citizens, fairly. Depending on the defenders to make the final decision of the leaders of our great country is an overlycautious effort to avoid a tie, which could be easily resolved.

You cannot deny, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be extremely beneficial for our country. Citizens would regain their Constitutionalright to vote for the leaders who make major decisions for the entire country. The Electoral College is useful to produce a clear winner in elections, but is evidently not completely necessary and is unfair to voters who want and deserve a say in the outcomePlumer 13, 14. Abolishing this system would cause for a drastically more fair election and greater citizen satisfaction for multitudinous reasons. Please consider. Thank you.",1,2e0fc60696d043078b25e7732daeb042
"The traditional Chinese culture regards cancer patients as being in a delicate state and not to be told the truth about their condition. This is in contrast to the western world, where patients are typically told the truth about their condition and given the opportunity to make decisions about their treatment. There are a number of reasons why the Chinese culture might view cancer patients in a different way.

One reason is that the Chinese culture places a lot of importance on family relationships. Cancer patients may feel that their family members are not supportive and may not want to hear the truth about their condition. This can be a very difficult experience for them and can lead to feelings of isolation.

Another reason is that the Chinese culture places a lot of importance on tradition. Many people in the Chinese culture believe that tradition should be upheld no matter what. This can be difficult for cancer patients, who may want to make changes to their traditional way of life.

Overall, the traditional Chinese culture regards cancer patients in a different way than the western world. While it is important to respect their wishes, it is also important to provide them with the information they need to make informed decisions about their treatment.

"The usage of motor vehicles has been on a steady decline for the last several years. More and more people are relying on carpooling and other means of transportation. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's articles, she discusses Vauban, Germany, where cars are forbidden and how the use of cars has been on the decline. In Robert buffer's article, he talks about Paris' issues with pollution and the ways it has been dealt with. In Andrew Selsky's article, he talks about a program in Colombia when citizens use other means of transportation other than cars. The perks of limiting car usage include less pollution, less traffic congestion, and improved safety.

The main culprit of pollution issues is car usage. In Source 2, Robert Duffer says that ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France...""Duffer 16 This is because of a tax policy that has a preference to this fuel. Diesel fuel is a lot more harmful than regular gasoline, and if many people are using this fuel pollution rates will skyrocket. Cutting down on these fuels altogether could create a less polluted environment. In addition, cars cause 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and 50 percent in specific places in the U.SRosenthal 5. This statistic is startling, since half of the pollution problems in the U.S are associated to cars. By using other means of transportation such as the train or even carpooling, this number can be greatly reduced to a much smaller percentage.

With more cars, more traffic congestion occurs. A sign of this congestion is evident when Rosenthal says""New York's new bikesharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities.Rosenthal 37"" A lot of people are still using their own vehicles to get from point A to B, and as a result their is more money that has been given to toll bridges because of that. The encouragement of governments to suggest carpooling services and shared rides will decrease the revenue that comes from tolls. If everybody shared a ride with a person from work or from somewhere else, there would be a great decrease in traffic congestion.

Furthermore, public transportation such as the BART in the San Francisco Bay area has decreased the amount of drivers on the road. Although the rides are typically longer than driving a car from point A to B, it is a more efficient method of transportation.Rosenthal 40 Using these alternate methods of transportation decreases the amount of cars on the road at once. With less cars on the road at once, there is more efficiency in getting where you need to go.

Safety is one of the most important aspects of reducing the amount of cars. In Colombia, a program promotes the use of no cars one day per year. Many of the citizens use alternate methods of transportation such as walking and riding bikes.Selsky 20By promoting this, there are obviously less cars on the road and a lesser risk of people being injured by cars. With programs that promote other modes of transportation, many lives can be saved since there would be fewer cars on the road. Although many people require cars to get from place to place, the idea of lives being saved is something that shouldn't be ignored. Also, technology has aided the decline in cars. Telecommunication has helped people become connected to friends and family in a way without meeting with them face to face.Rosenthal 35 Because of this, people dont have to travel to meet with their friends and family. This has created a domino effect people can communicate through social media and texting which causes less cars to be on the road to visit other people and overall causes less safety isssues.

In conclusion, cars are the focal point of many issues in our society. They cause many safety issues such as traffic accidents,more traffic congestion which causes increases in revenue in tolls, and pollution issues. By reducing car usage, many of these problems can disappear, and can create a safer and healthier environment.",1,8ecaedf222b74ce8b0a6bdec4629ab9e
"Throughout the past century car usage has exploded from a luxury available only to the highest echelon of society to a tool almost essential to life. Although cars are convenient there are many downsides to having them. Some reasons a society that limits car use could be beneficial are: expenses, environmental costs, and health degredation. Hopefully together we can curb car usage and lead the way for a cheaper, greener, and healthier future.

Its a known fact that cars are expensive, but when you add up all of the costs how much is really spent. Especially for younger drivers insurance is a ludicrous expense, often totalling hundreds of dollars per month. Another expense, obviously, is gas. Gas may be at a 5 year low right now but the slightest instability in oil producing countries could cause prices to skyrocket. Still if you add in the cost of the car your looking at a highly expensive way of living. Life obviously could be less expensive without car use.

Another illeffect of car use is environmental impact. car emissions are responsible for up to 50 percent of total green house gas emissions in some states. Using cars is not good for the environment. Cars pollute are atmosphere and can accelerate the rate of ozone layer deterioration. They also, indirectly, damage habitats by requiring new roads and highways to be built thus disturbing ecosystems. Automobiles also use large quantities of petroleum a finite and ever necessary resource in this global world. Car usage needs to be drastically reduced in order to preserve the environment.

Health issues can also develop from overusing cars. For instance, by looking at cultures that do not use cars it is evident that less children with autism are born to said peoples, such as the Amish. Another benefit of not using cars is exercise. People that drive instead of walking or bicycling are not only becoming more obese they are also putting themselves at an elevated risk for heart disease. Car accidents are one of the highest causes of premature death in the united states thus if people drove less these accidents would occur far less often. The choice seems clear a carless society is more healthy for all.

All in all, although cars may have benefits, the drawbacks of having them far out way any of said benefits. Car usage is expensive, bad for the environment and unhealthy. Together, society must ultimately decide whether life with automobiles is worth it and live with the consequences.",1,467ddf9907ba4f4394dbb16d8daa2817
"For starters, the power to read someones emotion is too much, what if the person dose not want to be read and would like some privacy. Facial recognition is already a thing and the reading emotions is a useless waste of tax dollars for more reason than one.

if this is a goverment funded project, then, one why, and two, what for. in the case that you are wasting money for things more immportant, like fixing the hunger epidemic, or stopping corupt people from oppressing others, you have decided to make a technology that reads faces, there are uses for this tech, but is it what we need or is it something that can wait untill everyone is happy and healthy. Understaning that there are uses for tech like this, what other uses does it have, the only thing for it is the ""makeing school lessons less boring"".

In another case, people not wanting to be read like a book and having it done anyway, dose not sound like fun. Creating a socity where everyone knows how everyone else feels, there are flaws that will devistate populations, perhaps someone dose not want to talk about somthing and the compter or cellphone with this new tech dose not know this, then offends the persson by telling a dark secret or spilling the beans about your emotions to some blabermouth that spits the info to the internet for example ""to an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling polititinn or celebrity isn't being truthful."" not only dose this tech give people the power to see through fake smiles, but it is also a hudge invasion of privacy and should be frowed upon, then again when has a polititian ever been truthful to begin with.

The main point is, with this tech taking away the ability to hold a secret, it makes our socity seem like robots and always wanting to be read like a book and have our emotions described as ""numbers on a spread sheet"" or words on a screen. The entire reason we are human is because we can read emotions without the use of a machiene telling us how we feel, insted of our friends asking us ""are you okay"" a computer program says ""you are feeling sad"" after some trgic event. Also the program has only basic emotions and feelings progamed into it, nothing as complex as a state of deep depretion.

However this program could be useful for diegosing depression and stats that doctors still have trouble finding. Imagine if insted of reading feeling and telling you how you feel, the program could, for say; recomend a way to feel better if you are sad, or help relive anger stress with some soothing music, and even help make sure everyone is happy with out the big buck spending for therpy of a phycologist.

In conclution there are both good and bad things this program can do, but with all that power come a lot of risk and exposure. Read somthing wrong and disaster wil stike. Leave something unchecked and things get out of hand, but worst of all if the program gliches or the machiene malfunctions and someone pays the price with their life.

"The pandemic of 2020 has been a difficult time for many, but in particular, it has had a profound impact on the elderly. The effects of social isolation and increased loneliness among older generations have caused widespread mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. With nursing homes and assisted living facilities unable to accept visitors due to safety protocols, this age group is experiencing an unprecedented level of alienation from their family members and peers. Being cut off from the outside world can easily lead to feelings of helplessness and hopelessness in seniors. This can be especially hard when they are already dealing with physical ailments that come with aging, making them more vulnerable to serious illnesses like Covid-19. As a result, many elderly people struggle with fear about their future due to concerns about contracting the virus or not receiving proper medical care if they do become infected. In addition to these worries, elders also face unique issues such as limited access to technology which hinders their ability to keep in touch via virtual means like video calls or emails. Moreover, they are often excluded from discussions related to digital advancements since much of the conversation takes place online without taking into account those who may not have access or knowledge on how use it effectively. If left unaddressed, this type of disconnection could pose serious long-term consequences by further isolating them within society at large. . . Fortunately there are ways we can bridge the gap between elderly individuals and younger generations during this trying time so that loneliness doesn't become an even bigger problem than it already is today. One way is through volunteer initiatives where volunteers visit seniors by sitting outdoors while following necessary safety precautions such as wearing masks and maintaining social distance guidelines set forth by public health organizations . Another important action step would be for families living closeby to check up on elder members regularly either virtually over phone calls or through visits if possible – these small gestures help create meaningful connections which serve as invaluable sources of support during times of hardship .

"Dear state senator,

I ask you  to change the voting methods to popular vote instaed of Electoral collage because the candidates for presidency give no importance to small states that do not have many electoral collage votes; focus more on those that have many Electoral collage votes and candidates for presidency dont need to be the most popular of all to win the presidency.

Candidates don't really care for small states with small population because they know that they don't matter in the resultof them being elected as president or not. According to ""The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford  Plumer ""Seventeen states didn't see the candidates al all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get so see a single campain as. ""You may ask yourself why they didn't see any of of this well one thing that both of them share is that they dont have as many electoral collage votes as other states like Califoprnia that has 55 electoral votes. And it's a winner take all the less popular candidate from the state doesn't get any votes at all.

You dont have to be the most popular in the nation in order to win the precidency and its a winner take all. According to the ""The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are wrong"" by Bradford  Plumer ""Voters vote not for the president, but for a slater of elctors, who in turn elect the president."" For example when bush was running for precident he was not the most popular in the natuion and Gore was, in the end Bush was elected president for winning more the electoral votes then Gore. This is unfair for many people because more then half the nation didn't want Bush but yet he was elected without the popular vote.

However According to ""In Defense of the Electoral Collage: Five reasons to keep our despised methods of choosing the

President""  by Richard A. Posner there is less likely to be a dispute over the electoral collage votes then in a dispute over the popular vote. It also requires a a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. ""The electoral collage avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

This is why I ask you state senator to change from Electoral Collage voting methed to The Popular voting to elect The President Of The United states Of America  because the candidates for presidency give no importance to small states that do not have many electoral collage votes and care more for those that do plus the candidate doesn't have to be the most popular in the to win the elections to become the President of the U.S.A.",1,7769d9736c7c47a6965a163acecdf049
"Some people say that the Face on planet Mars is just a natural landform; is it really? Maybe it is maybe it isn't. Some people think that the Face was an alien formation of some sort. Mars, along with many other planets have strange things on their planet. Whether it's a crater, a wierd looking shape, or whatever it may be. It could just be that it was formed like that. Have you ever been walking outside on a sidewalk or even found something shaped, or formed into something that you have seen before it may be a face carved into a rock, or something carved into cement. Maybe that is what happened with the Face on Mars.

In the text it says, ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artiifcat, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1997, eighteen longs years after the Viking missions ended."" In the beginning of the sentence it says that few scientists think that the face was an alien artifact. That might be true but it says that FEW scientists believe the face was alien. Few isn't many.

The text has something else that will amaze some of you, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers, were waiting when the image first apperared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" The text said it all. They have a picture to show that the Face is just a natural landform that this planet has made. And it may just look happen to look like a face.

As you read on in the excerpt it says, ""What the picture actually showws is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" The key word is landforms, landforms form all over earth; why not on other planets as well?

Some people may still be conviced that it was an alien artificat that did all this. They may think in their minds that nothing can look that much like a face; some things actually can. Again if you go outside and say you find a rock that is shaped funny, then you pick it up and it looks like a face, unless someone did that on purpose, that was earth's creation.

Now you may ask why, but, I assure you that the electoral college is a way for corrupt presidential candidates to win the office and make this great nation a horrible place. To back up my reasoning here are 3 reasons as to why you should consider voting against the electoral college. Segregationists replacing voters of one candidate for another, the election could become a catastrophe if a tie were to happen, there is a chance of a ""disaster factor"" happening.

In 1960 segregationists in Louisiana nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose J.F.K. Source 2, Bradford Plumer, The indefensible electoral college: why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong, P. 11, line 44 Imagine if the corrupter had been able to corrupt the election, we might have had a fiasco bigger than the 2000 presidential fiasco. If we were to continue to turn our backs on the matter we would soon be run by fatasses who spent all their time gaming and would claim they know exactly how the system works, opposed to a real man who spent all his time rising from the bottom up and knows the system by heart. Who do you think would win if those 2 people were to run for President? Not the one who should.

Some people claim an electoral tie is impossible, but, in 1968 a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election, if that doesn't seem so bad lets take a look at how many people are in the United States alone. In 1976 a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 from Hawaii had voted the other way. Plumer, P. 12, line 80 The election is really only a few swing voters away from catastrophe, and possibly, the worst government shutdown these United States have ever seen. So, if 41,971 voters from 1968 didn't seem like alot, then lets look at the 9,246 voters from 1976, ties are seemingly getting closer and closer, what will happen when it is too late?

There is always the off chance of a ""disaster factor"" occuring, like the one in the 2000 Al Gore VS. Bush Presidential election. Imagine if that were to happen again, only, this time, we put a blood thirsty, war hungry, nuclear savage into office. Imagine the Iraq and Afghanistan wars from 2000present and then imagine them being fought on our own soil, imagine, instead of little Iragi children fighting against an invading force, your children fighting against an invading force, and that is just one of the minor things that could happen. Imagine if we put a man in office who thought the way to answer everything was through nuclear war, imagine what would happen to the United States. These are just a few examples of what could happen if another ""disaster factor"" were to happen again.

These are the 3 reasons as to why i believe you should consider voting against using the electoral college. Imagine if We the People actually got to vote OUR favorite president into office on OUR own terms instead of some idiots a political party throws together, imagine how much better off we would be than we are now.",1,7c70a39d1323469db55d56582156480f

"The concept of free will has been a topic of debate since the dawn of civilization, and even today it remains a controversial issue. Some argue that free will is an illusion, while others believe it to be one of our most fundamental rights as human beings. As with any philosophical discussion, there are no definitive answers – but by examining the arguments from both sides more closely we can gain insight into what this concept truly means for us. Those who believe in free will assert that every person has the ability to make choices about their lives regardless of external influences such as upbringing or environment. They point out that although certain conditions might influence decisions, choice is ultimately up to each individual and cannot be imposed on anyone else. Supporters cite evidence like psychological experiments which show how individuals respond differently under similar circumstances, proving that decision-making processes are unique and unpredictable even when faced with identical options. On the other hand, those who oppose free will argue that all choices are predetermined by factors beyond our control; whether its genetics or societal norms dictating behavior in ways we do not recognize or understand fully yet still obey without question. The idea behind this argument is that if everything were predetermined then there would be no real possibility for autonomy; after all if nothing could ever really change then neither could life itself making true freedom impossible for humans to attain. . While opinions about this issue vary greatly between people and cultures, one thing seems clear – at least in terms of beliefs - understanding what constitutes “free will” may bring us closer to unlocking some deeper truths about ourselves and our world than previously thought possible before now! Whether it's an innate power granted by nature or simply something we choose to exercise despite preordained obstacles placed upon us by society either way recognizing its importance helps keep our minds open towards further growth potentials offering new paths forward towards building better lives together!

"It is hard to imagine car-free or car limiting cities, but it could happen in the near future. Many people like owning and driving cars. However, cars are causing major problems in some areas of the world, so we could see less cars in the future.

One of the biggest issues that cars cause is the carbon emissions that they release. In America, the second largest source of emissions are from cars (Source 4). This doesnt' seem like an issue to Americans, but in places like Beijing, China, which is one of the most polluted cities in the world (Source 2), emissions are very harmful. Citizens of Beijing have to wear mask when they walk around the city so that they don't get sick or poisoned from the carbon emissions. Even a 1st world country, like France, had carbon emissions that rivaled Beijing(Source 2). So as you can see, the emissions that cars give off could become a more serious issue in America, especially if you live in a place like New York City. If more cities become less congested, they will be much safer.

Speaking of New York City, cars are already a big issue. If you have been to New York City, you should know that the streets are so congested with traffic that it is faster to walk or ride a bike to get around the city. Not only are the streets congested, the air is very polluted from the emissions given off by cars. However, in Vauban, Germany, residents are giving up their cars for streets that are mostly ""car-free"" (Source 1). Few residents own cars and that means that the streets are quiet and clear and greenhouse emission have drastically decreased. Residents say that they are happier without cars and eaverything they need is within walking distance (Source 1). This could quite possibly be what happens to many cities and suburbs in the near future.

The last thing that I would like to fill you in on is that car ownership in America has been steadily declining. Research has shown that the number of young peole driving has decreased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 (Source 4). Because of this, many people use Public Transport to get where they need to go. This is likely due to the fact that many Americans don't have the money to buy cars, so they don't make it a priority (Source 4). Also, young people feel less inclined to drive because they can connect with their friends through the internet (Source 4).

By no means am I saying that you should not own a car, I'm am just explaining to you that a car-limited future is looking more and more possible. In many ways it could be very beneficial, but it still has a long way to go before I can see it becoming reality.",1,d7f6e851b6b447cd9e4b09361dc5d3e2
"Some think that the Face on Mars was made my aliens. Some think that its a natural landform. Some even think that the similar earth landforms were formed by aliens.

I believe that the Face is a natural landform. The large landform on Mars is very similar and naturally made like landforms on earth and even more specifically the American West. A very good example of this is the Middle Butte in the Snack River Plain of Idaho.

The landforms such as the Middle Butte in the Snack River Plain of Idaho are made from a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Knowing how the formation in Idaho is formed increases the evidence showing how easy it would be for Mars to have a similar landform. it is very well a natural landform, just on a different planet. Mars is such a similar planet to earth that the lantural landforms could be, and in this case are, very similar.

No matter what you believe, rather it is a natural formation or made by an ancient life form or aliens, all the evidence and proof points to, and proves, that the Face on Mars is in fact, just a natural landform that is most likely an equivalent of a bette or mesa.",1,d509d05f96034a648246b14463e52487

Imagination can provide a solution to the unanswerable, can turn obstacles into opportunities, and can create a path where none existed before. Imagination is essential, both in our personal as well as our professional lives, because it enables us to cast aside the limits of knowledge and see the bigger picture.

Take, for instance, a young child. Children are able to use their imagination in amazing ways, to conjure up stories, pictures or objects of their own making. Parents and educators often praise this sort of creative thinking, as it allows the child to take risks free from the anxiety of being wrong. 

More importantly, imagination can be used to bridge gaps for the differently-abled. For the blind, for example, it is not knowledge that might help a person find his or her way, but rather the ability to imagine one's surroundings. It is imagination that allows them to visualise a street corner or a store, and to traverse a path that may have been previously unknown. 

In conclusion, imagination is considered more important than knowledge because it is far more versatile, powerful, and adaptive. It is the tool we need when knowledge fails us; it is the key to creative thinking; and it allows for a measure of flexibility and creativity that knowledge alone cannot offer.",0,0d245e83dac446f69d8e06726aeb1956
"The author idea is is it worthy to be studying Venus without putting people in danger.

I tink its worthy because if Earth can't be a place where humans can live they have to another planet where people can lve at.

Venus is called the twin of Earth because its close to Earth in terms and density. Many spacecrafts was sent to Venus but none of the spacecraft have survived more than a few hours. More than three decades no spaceship have touched Venus again . Venus is one of the plaents that is hard to study because of its tempurtures and reputation. Venus atmosphere is almost 97% of carbon dioxide. The clouds in Venus are more challenging because the have highly corrosive sulfuric acid.

Also the temperatures average are over 800 degrees Fahrenhiet and the atmospheric perssure is 90 times greater than Earth. The conditions of Venus are more extreme than Earth. For example the environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Venus has the hotter temperatures in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to our sun. even though high pressures and heat the weather present addtional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

"When we're having difficulty deciding what to do,we turn to someone in hopes of them giving us advice. For example, when you're at a resturant and you don't know what to get, you ask somebody else what they believe is a good option. Sometimes, you may even ask more than one person. Asking for more opinions from different people can lead to better choices. When asking for advice, think about the type of person they are, what kind of experience they had, and what option would be best for you.

There are many different types of people in this world. Some can be quiet and introverted; others can be loud and outgoing. When you're taking advice from somebody, consider: their personality, what they like, and what they don't like. Imagine you're deciding whether or not to go to a concert. If you ask someone who doesn't like them if you should go or not, they're most likely tell you no. If you ask someone who likes concerts, they're more likely to say yes. What they belive you should do all depends on what type of person they are and what they'd personally enjoy.

Last summer, my mom signed my brothers up for a summer camp. One enjoyed it because his friends were in the same group as him. However, my other brother hated it because he didn't like the people he was grouped with.

When I asked if I should go, if it would be fun, only one said yes. The different experiences they both had made them have different opinions about the camp as a whole.

Lastly, when asking for advice, the most important thing is to ask yourself is, ""Is this something I actually want to do?"" When considering your options, it all comes down to choosing what's right for you. Sometimes, asking multiple people for their opinion can leave you confused and even more frustrated than before. If you get to this point, think about the pros and cons of each choice. Decide whether or not it's the best option or if there's a better one for you.

All in all, hearing opinions from multiple people can help you make a better choice because it helps you narrow down the pros and cons. Everyone is a different person and everyone has different experiences. Getting advice from many people is an important part in problem-solving. It helps you find solutions to minor problems- like what to eat for dinner, and it can help you find solutions to greater problems- whether you should move houses or not. Sure, hearing advice from many people can be frustrasting, but it can also change your life for the better.",1,b8abf0b7722f49b6b449d314c711bf7f
"Education is undoubtedly one of the most important factors that contribute to the development and progress of any society. While both boys and girls need education, many people believe that educating girls is more critical in ensuring the progress of a nation. I firmly agree with the African proverb that states, ""If you educate a boy, you educate an individual; if you educate a girl, you educate a family and a nation."" In this essay, I will provide specific reasons and examples to support my agreement.

To begin with, educating a girl leads to the education of her family. In many developing countries, women are often the primary caregivers of children and other family members. When a girl receives an education, she is more likely to use her knowledge to educate her siblings and her own children. For instance, in Pakistan, women who have completed primary education are more likely to ensure their daughters get the chance to attend school, which leads to higher literacy rates for the next generation. Therefore, educating a girl creates a ripple effect that will lead to the education of many others.

Moreover, educating a girl leads to a significant reduction in child marriage and early pregnancies. When girls have access to education, they are more likely to delay marriage and childbirth until they are ready. According to a report by UNICEF, educating adolescent girls can reduce child marriage by up to two-thirds. Furthermore, educated women are more likely to have healthier pregnancies and fewer children, leading to more resources to invest in their education and their family's well-being.

Finally, educating girls leads to economic growth and development. Women are often excluded from economic opportunities, and this impedes the growth and progress of their societies. Educated women are more likely to participate in the workforce, earn higher wages, and contribute to their countries' economies. For example, in Bangladesh, women's participation in the workforce has led to a 2% increase in GDP every year.

In conclusion, educating a girl is one of the most effective ways to ensure the progress and development of a society. Educated women are more likely to educate their families, delay marriage and childbirth, and contribute to their countries' economies. Therefore, governments and organizations must prioritize girls' education and ensure that they have access to quality education. By doing so, we can create a better future for our societies and the world as a whole.

Honesty is a virtue that is often overlooked and undervalued in society. It can be difficult to trust a person you know is not completely honest, and dishonesty makes it difficult for relationships, whether personal or professional, to thrive. This is why honesty is the best policy in almost all scenarios. 

Given that honesty is the foundation of trust, it is more important than ever to be honest in our interactions. By being honest, we establish relationships based on trust and mutual respect. For example, in a business setting, if you can be honest about a situation or outcome, regardless of the consequences, it will yield better results than if you decide to be dishonest. Honesty is not always easy, but it is always the best course of action. 

In personal relationships, honesty is also the best policy. We all have experienced betrayal from people who we have trusted and who have lied to us. Knowing that a person is honest with you can give you a sense of peace knowing that they will never betray you. Honesty in relationships can help people grow closer to one another, as it encourages open conversations and mutual understanding. 

In summary, honesty is essential for forming and maintaining relationships, both personal and professional. By being honest, we acknowledge our mistakes and learn from them, which strengthens our character. Honesty also leads to trust and respect, which are essential components of any healthy relationship.",0,397f8cbbf09641cd9343b87752c3490a
"Most people have heard of the small, but highly influential nation-state of Singapore. Located in Southeast Asia, this city-state is known for its modern marvels and incredible economic success story. Drawing upon the experiences and lessons learned throughout its history, Singapore has become a leader in many aspects related to urban development, public health and environmental sustainability. Singapore's success was forged with ambitious leadership from the very beginning - when it first gained independence from Malaysia in 1965. The newly independent state quickly launched a series of aggressive initiatives aimed at improving social welfare and stimulating economic growth through investments in infrastructure, education, healthcare and other sectors that would lay the groundwork for robust prosperity over subsequent decades. Central to these efforts were an unprecedented focus on environmentally sound policies such as land reclamation projects that provided much needed housing without sacrificing green spaces or natural ecosystems; energy conservation measures such as implementing efficient systems like district cooling services; reinvestment strategies protecting wildlife habitats while also encouraging sustainable fisheries; water management reforms designed to minimize waste while optimizing use efficiency; public transportation upgrades including rapid transit options connecting communities both near and far away; improved air quality standards focused on reducing particulate matter emissions; renewable resource technologies oriented towards limiting reliance on fossil fuels when possible; along with a long list of other groundbreaking developments made possible by wise governmental decisions focused on preparing Singapore for whatever challenges may arise in future generations. Today, Singapore stands out among world cities not just because of its awe inspiring skyline or dazzling financial prowess but due to their unwavering commitment towards preserving Mother Nature’s gifts whilst developing into one of most advanced urban landscapes around the globe – this forward thinking attitude is what makes it truly unique . The culture here supports cleanliness and safety,, citizens are taught effective practices regarding waste disposal which reduces pollution levels significantly.

"Since Smartphones were released to the public, they have become a huge part of most people's day to day life. It's the first thing they look at in the morning and the last thing they see before sleep. This electronic takeover has had a very big affect on distracted driving, causing many innocent lives to be lost all because of a Text message. Driving is a skill that requires constant focus on the road and the others on the road with you. Carless or negligent driving doesn't just affect the person doing the act, it also effects everyone around the distracted driver.

Texting and driving incidents are one of the most reported problems in the US right now. In 2013, 3,154 people were killed in distraction-related crashes, about 424,000 people were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver and 10% of all drivers ages 15 to 19 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash. Distracted driving has had a huge impact on many young Impressionable drivers who are very prone to starting bad habits that may lead to accidents involving other drivers on the road. Phones should not be involved with driving because they are simply too distracting and there is clear evidence that supports it, many lives can be saved and avoid all the pointless pain and agony caused to the people involved.

There are laws set in place to protect us that make sure people aren't distracted while driving, and if they are there are consequences that could even result in the revocation of their licenses. I believe these laws benefit society as a whole. If we were to not have these laws, then the death rates in the US would sky-rocket past the limits they already are. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year and texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk.

With a problem that is so avoidable I hope that people can come together and realize what texting and driving is doing to the world and that all we have to do is follow the law and stay focused while driving to not only protect ourselves, but all the innocents around us. Together everyone can make a change by making the right decision when on the road.

"The question of whether young people enjoy life more than older people is one that has been debated for many years. In my opinion, I believe that although there are advantages and disadvantages to both age groups, overall, young people enjoy life more than older people.

One of the key advantages of youth is that young people have more time and energy to do the things that they enjoy. For instance, young people are generally more active and adventurous, and they are more likely to take part in activities such as sports, travelling, and socialising with friends. This gives them the opportunity to experience new and different things, and makes life more exciting and enjoyable. On the other hand, older people may not be able to do these activities due to physical limitations or other commitments, such as work or looking after family. In addition, young people are more likely to be open to new ideas and experiences, which can also be a source of enjoyment.

Another factor that makes life more enjoyable for young people is that they generally have fewer responsibilities. When you’re young, you don’t usually have to worry about things like bills, mortgages, or caring for a family. Instead, you have more freedom to pursue your own interests and can focus on enjoying life without the pressure of work or other commitments. On the other hand, older people often have to juggle multiple responsibilities and commitments, which can be stressful and draining.

Finally, young people tend to have more optimism about the future. When you’re young, you haven’t yet experienced the hardships or disappointments of life, so you tend to have a more positive outlook. This can help to make life more enjoyable, as you look forward to the future with optimism. Older people, on the other hand, may be more pessimistic, as they have experienced more of life’s difficulties.

In conclusion, I believe that young people generally enjoy life more than older people. This is due to the fact that they have more energy, fewer responsibilities, and a more optimistic outlook on the future.

"Seeking advice from multiple people when faced with an important decision can be greatly beneficial. Getting different perspectives exposes you to a wider range of ideas, insights, and potential outcomes you may not have considered on your own. No single person has all the answers or sees every angle of a situation. By consulting others, you gain access to their varied backgrounds, experiences, and ways of thinking. 

One advantage is getting advice tailored to your specific circumstances. Different people will know you to different degrees and understand different aspects of your situation. Laying out details of your context allows advisors to provide carefully considered guidance aimed directly at your needs. Nobody knows you or your scenario as thoroughly as you, so sharing information helps ensure you receive advice most applicable to your unique case.

A second benefit is that multiple opinions help balance or cancel out biases. Any one person comes to topics with internalized tendencies, assumptions, and preconceptions that color their judgment. While another's biases may align positively with your interests, it's also possible biases could lead advice down an unhelpful path. Hearing a variety of takes increases the chances of pinpointing advice limited or slanted by biases versus that which gives a full, impartial view. This multidimensional perspective helps you make a choice grounded in objective reality rather than filtered through any one lens. 

Finally, seeking multiple perspectives fosters more creative problem-solving. Bouncing ideas between several minds spawns new solutions built from the synthesis of diverse input. One advisor may suggest an approach another finds flaws with, yet their discussion sparks an alternative option even better. An array of views increases odds of entertaining unorthodox thinking that leads to an optimal decision. Where a single person may see one path forward, many cooks can conceive three or five viable options.

In conclusion, weighing choices aligned with varied counsel ensures a decision rooted in well-rounded critical thought. Consulting more than one trusted person exposes you to invaluable market research of alternate takes and untapped solutions, leading to the choice most thoroughly considered from all angles. The diversity of input maximizes informed decision making.",0,d9d66d5e2f9341609f9ccef7ffb35908
"Dear Senator,

I feel the need to eliminate the Electoral College process of voting and just have a regular election where the President with the most votes wins, as simple as that. Each vote counts as one, and there will be more or less votes depending on the state and its size and population.

Just like Source 2, I feel ""The Electroal College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. "" ""Abolish the electroal college!"". When you vote, you vote for ""a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President"" (Source 2, Paragraph 2). Why can't it just be a regular election where you either bubble your democrat or republican representative instead of being so complicated and misleading. This can get people confused, and get them to vote for the wrong candidate without them even realizing! ""Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" (Source 2, Paragraph 2). In the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't even get to see the candidates in a campaign ads; they focus on the ""bigger"" and more important swing-states to win. Each person should count as one, and each state should be as important as the other, just varying in the number of voters they had.

In Source 1, it says how ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" You're electing electors instead of just who you want for President. To top it off, you can't even control who your electors vote for! So people can vote for an elector thinking that he's going to vote for the Republican party but then he votes for the Democratic party. This process can be very misleading. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."". The disaster factor as mentioned in Source 2 could aways occur.

Some counter-arguments might include the certainty of outcome, and how the Electoral Vote might be greater than the Popular Vote. But at the end of the day, the people are nominating their president, they don't want others to do it for them. The Popular Vote representing our country as a whole with all individual votes added up should be the deciding factor. A tie is almost impossible in that circumstance also, because what are the chances out of millions of citizens the number would be perfectly split in half. If a president appeals for a region, then  let them vote for who they believe is the better candidate. At the end of the day, the majority wins. Swing states won't have to be a factor without the Electoral College, and big states are just counted them same, one point per vote. Run-off elections won't be necessary if the highest percentage president wins, even if its not majority.

So, hopefully you see my view on this issue and the Electoral College can be eliminated.

Sincerely,

Gabe",1,3cfb975898ad49a98a05dc134a7cebac

"Cars have been in use ever since World War II. Yet, more and more people have been limiting their usage of cars. Many take the alternative of bikes or buses, which ultimately creates benefits for not only one's self, but as well as all of the other people within the area. The benefits of limiting car usage are lowering pollution, creating less road and city congestion, and stress relief.

First of all, people have known for years that cars are a large source of air pollution. However, what most don't know is that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive area in the United States"" (Rosenthal, Elizabeth Paragraph 5). ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" (Duffer, Robert Paragraph 15). Therefore, not only do the car emissions go into the atmosphere, but it gets trapped there, so the more cars being used, the more emissions get built up and added. By limiting the usage of cars, the car emissions in the atmosphere that create air pollution can be reduced.

Secondly, many big cities have to deal with cars and traffic congesting the area. ""BOGOTA, Colombia-In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (Selsky, Andrew Paragraph 20). This allowed more room for people to move along the roads and without having to worry of being hit by a car. ""Rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic"" (Selsky, Andrew Paragraph 28). In doing so has allowed for pedestrians to be safer when crossing roads. A benefit in which prevents a hospital bill.

Lastly, stress relief can come from limiting the usage of cars, including relieving stress. ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked the verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor"" (Rosenthal, Elizabeth Paragraph 3). Heidrun isn't the only one who agrees that life without a car is less stressful. ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife"" (Selsky, Andrew Paragraph 24). Arturo and his wife were participants of the Colombian car-free day program. When you live a stressless life, it is proven that you can live longer, especially when replacing your car with exercise.

In conclusion, the benefits that come with limiting car usage are a healthier world. One, by replacing your car with exercise and relieving stress. Two, by lessening road accidents. Three, by lessening air pollution, which is not only better for the environment, but yourself. By limiting car usage, all of the benefits work out in your personal favor.",1,858d941e53da404db62a54235a805fad
"The art of cooking can be seen as a reflection of the culture it originates from. This is exemplified in traditional Italian cuisine, which offers an abundance of flavor and complexity that cannot be found elsewhere. The flavors and techniques found in Italian cooking provide a unique set of tools for chefs to create dishes that are both delicious and impressive. The flavors used in Italian dishes often rely heavily on fresh ingredients such as herbs, spices, vegetables, fruits, cheese, meats and fish. These components combine to create layers upon layers of complex flavor profiles featuring elements such as sweetness contrasted with acidity or herbaceousness balanced against saltiness. It's these kinds of combinations that make Italian food so special; each bite packs multiple dimensions into a cohesive yet intricate dish. Cooking methods are also key when preparing traditional Italian meals; slow-cooking is common since it allows for more time for flavors to develop fully while keeping moisture content high within the dish itself. Additionally, olive oil plays an important role not only in terms of its nuanced flavor but also its nutritional benefits—it aids digestion by increasing absorption rates within the body due to its high concentration levels of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). Additionally, presentation is not overlooked when it comes to traditional Italian cuisine; simple garnishes like oregano sprigs or lemon wedges add visual appeal alongside added aroma or brightness respectively . Gelato may also be offered after a meal as a sweet endnote - something else uniquely characteristic within this type of cooking style. Ultimately while there may be similarities between other cultural cuisines at their core they remain distinctively different – especially true with classic Italy fare!

"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the autor describes how the new technology is good because it knows what a lot of stuff ""the process begins when the computer construcets a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44major muscles in the model must move like huan muscles"".

I think that this is kind cool because if it can tell if you are sad or happy that would help out a lot of kids and adalts to see how ther kides are doing. ""To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle cules are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling""politician or celebrity isn't being truthful"".

"Asking only one person for advice is not going to get the advice that you are looking for because sometimes one persons opinion is not helpful. Because people have different thought's so the advice they give might be different than what you need. And some people ask more than one person because they want to know if its the right thing to do or not.

One persons opinion might not be helpful because it can be what they would do. And you may not be like the person who gave you the advice so it wont be helpful to you. Or the advice they give can be the opisite of what you asked. Some people are rude and wont help you so you dont want to follow help from people who are lying to you. So their opinions won't be helpful for you because it can be what they would do and the advice could be the opisite of what you need.

You also want to ask other people for advice because People have different thoughts so the advice they give will be different than what your thinking. One persons thoughts might not be what you want so you will probably need more peoples thoughts to back you up. People are different than you so asking more people can help you get what you need.

Sometimes people just ask other people because they want to know if its the right thing to do. You could get one persons opinion and be worryed if thats what you should do. Because it just sounds weird or its just not what you think is right. Two people could could say different things so you will want to ask more people to see if thats the right thing for you. Because what one of those people say might be the answer your looking for but the other person is your friend or someone you like a lot, so listning to them makes more sense.

In conclusion geting advice from more than one person looks pretty appropriate because 1-One persons opinion is probably not helpful 2-people have different thoughts so they will be different than what you need and 3-You want to know if its the right thing to do.",1,e9dc6afb0a004e38ab6172a5f431e399
"Dear state senator,

I think that we should keep the Electoral College. By keeping the Electoral College, there will be no problems in elections to where no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. The process is like a ""winner-take-all"" system. In the Electoral College a presidental candidate must have trans-regional appeal.

To begin, there are run-off elections. Run-off elections will make sure that no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. The Electorial College will help make it clearer to see which candidate is the winner. For an example in 1992 Clinton had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, then won a majority in the Electoral College.

Next, the Electoral College has a ""winner-take-all"" process. States such as Florida (29), Texas (38) and California (55) have a high amount of electoral votes. If there was a tie between two candidates and the votes from Florida were not put in yet, one of the candidates has a better chance of winning. Most candidates will try to persuade and win the higher states votes so that they will have a better chance of winninig. What's nice about the Electoral College, it causes the toss-up states to pay close attention the the campaign.

Finally, every candidate running for office must have a trans-regional appeal. None of the regions in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect the new president. When a canidate goes and campains in one region without thinking about he will not gain his electoral votes. Normally a candidate that has only regional appeal will be unlikely to be a successful president.

To conclude, the choice of keeping the Electoral College would very very wise and helpful. The Electoral College makes sure that there are run-off elections, it has a ""winner-take-all"" system, and that every canidadte running should be trans-regional. Even though in the Electoral College is not democratic and that only a slate of electors vote, a decent amount of times of when the people would pick that one candidate the electors would pick the same one.",1,8ef2565b13bc4442ab08ec3c2069ecf9
"Using technology that reads emotions in a student classroom is good because its caculates emotion, recognize subtle facial movements, and can mirror a suggested emotion. According to the text, it states by weighing different units the software can identify mixed emotions. Like they use the Mona Lisa picture to measure mixed emotion and she was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry, well at least thats what the computer software says. The software can also recognize subtle facial movements like if you smile when an ads apears they computer will send similar ads and if you frown then they will change the ad. Then it's good for students because the computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored. That means it would modify the lesson like an effective human instructor. If the computer can act like a human bein that would be good because most human communication is nonverbal. Also the computer can mirror a suggested emotion. The computer knows a face that looks happy. The computer knows the muscular action units of the face. Like the article says ""you tighten your lips to show anger"", that is the same angry face that could be used to a video game. So, yes this type of technology would be great to use in a school because it calculates emotion, recognize facial movements, and could mirror imagery.",1,40216296ad024c0e967abb7c08d8da9c

"The advantage of limiting your car use are extremly helpful mainly to are envoriment. Some countries are now banging people from using there vehicals to get the smog levels down. There goal is to promote alternative transportation and ruduce smog.

""It's a good oppotunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" said businessman Carlos Arturo as he road a two-seat bicycle with his wife. In Bogota, Colombia there is a day where everyone has a car-free day. It also releaves on the traffic jams and also reduces the amount of accidents. On that day vioators faced $25 fines, might be a little extreme but its a good way to get the people thinking of new and smarter ways to travel. If in a city of 7 million everyone can join in, why cant states and countries try this?

If we had car-free days maybe once every month or twice a month that would help keep are envirorment heathy and clean. Parks and sports centers would also greatly bloom, more people would want to get out and enjoy life more. Less harm to are earth will make sure it last longer and they way are kids kids can be able to see what a wonderful planet we have.

I feel that less cars should be used, more walking and bike riding less gas more money in are pockets.

"I have just read ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" and many people are convinced that the Face, found near Cydonia, is just a natural landform. However, there are also many people who believe this Face to be of extra-terresrial activity. However, NASA has gave us more facts that prove the Face to be a mountain-like landform rather than an extra-terrestrial phenomenon.

First of all, many photos taken by NASA themselves show no evidence of aliens, but natural landmasses. On April 5, 1998, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) over Cydonia. MIchael Malin and his team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Once that happened, it was revealed to the public that the Face was just a landform. This proves that the mass was indeed a landmass. Also, these pictures were taken after the original one(the one that got everyone speculatng about the origin of the landmass), which means that the new pictures are much clearer and thus more believable han the original.

Secondly, many of the theories around the Face of Mars being a definite sign of aliens, are all conspiracy theories. The fifth paragraph states,"" Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" This quote from the article proves that there are many people who make up theories that have no credibility or legs to stand on. Also, many of these claims hold no cocrete evidence but are rather based on speculation.

Finally, NASA deployed the MGS yet again on April 8, 2001- a cloudless day in Cydonia. Paragraph ten explains,"" We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution."" Also, paragraph twelve states,"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the American West."" These quotes prove that the picture was the best resolution it be, and the Face was still depicted as a landmass. Also, they compare these landforms to landforms commonly found in the American West. This concludes that the Face is not of any extra-terrestrial activity, but just a misunderstanding made by conspiracy theorist.

In conclusion, based on the evidence from the article, the Face is in fact a landform of Mars. This states that there is no extra-terrestial life in our universe( as of right now). This article teaches people that you should not listen to conspiracy theories, but facts that have evidence to support it.",1,d4f7855000654952b6b32a9817789f86
"When it comes to learning English, many people believe that both reading and speaking are equally important skills. The reason for this is that both skills help learners to understand the English language and to communicate with others.

Reading is important because it allows learners to understand the English language on a deeper level. By reading, learners can learn about the grammar and vocabulary of the English language. This knowledge can help learners to improve their English reading skills.

Speaking is also important because it allows learners to practice their English skills. Speaking allows learners to practice their pronunciation and fluency. This practice can help learners to improve their speaking skills.

Overall, both reading and speaking are important skills for Chinese learners of English. Both skills help learners to improve their English skills.

"Yes the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. The Facil Action Coding System technology is valuable because. It could help the students learn lessons easier and better. As it says in paragraph 6 line 7 through 10 stating that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. Students that have the Facial Action Coding System technology avilable to them would learn faster then some of the other students in the classroom. The FACST (Facial Action Coding System Technology) can see and understand the emotion of the student in the case if a student is getting confused or not. Sometimes a student might be messing around and want to lie and be funny and act like he is confused but the FACST (Facial Action Coding System Technology) can understand the student better and figure out if the student is really confused or just lying. When the FACST (Facial Action Coding System Technology) recongizes that a student is really confused or lost. Say if it's a reading assignment and the student speaks and only understands spanish and if the spanish audio is going to fast. The FACST can see a bit of confusion and worrying on the students face and it could modify the lesson to make the audio go slower so the spanish speaking student can understand what he is being read better. The FACST could also recongize if a studemt is depressed or sad and the students or parents and teachers don't know about it yet it could possibly just email it to the teacher of the student amd to the parents. Saying something for example you'r child today wasn't very focused and seemed a bit depressed you should have talk with you'r child. By doing that the FACST might also be able to prevent students like teens maybe that are in deppression but their parents don't know about it yet from commiting sucide. So overall the FACST (Facial Action Coding System Technology) is very valuable and useful in a classroom for the students teacher and parents.",1,c3bf9826bf1948cc86f17aff55bdb3e8
"Have you ever wondered what your life would be like if you did not have to drive as much. Maybe you didn't have a car at all. A small experimental suburb in Germany is tooling with the idea of a no car life style, along with many cities in the United States where a car is not a neccesity. Paris however has banned car usage all together, becuase of the amount of smog produced becuase of the automobiles. This could marke the end of car culture across many countries, exspecially the United States. There are many advantages to not owning or using a car, some of them may just cause you to get ride of your car.

A small suburb in Germany on the France and Swiss border have given up on their cars. ""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in the experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg."" The streets of this small town are car free. The twon offers a tram that runs through the downtown, and a few small streets on one edge of the community. The town cannot bain cars altogether, but if you own a car the only place to store it is in large garages at the edge of the town. One space can cost $40,000, the cost of the space comes with the home. Only 70 percent of the population in Freiburg owns a car and 57 percent sold there vehicle before moving. Germany isn't the only country with this type of movement. The United States is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. This will cause increase demand of public transport to the suburbs surrounding big cities such as Chicago and New York.

Paris, however, is the first city to prohibit driving altogether. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial drribing ban to clear the air of the global city. Drivers where asked to leave their cars at home or risk a fine of 22 -euro ($31). Almost 4,000 drivers where fined. Diesel fuel was blamed becuase France has a tax policy which promotes diesel fuel. Almost 70% of drives have diesel vehicles. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, but exceptions where made for hybrids and electric vehicles. The public transit was free of charge during the bane.

""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emission, unveiled last week."" American now is has fewer car sales, people driving less, and there are fewer and fewer liscences each year. Americas love of motor vehicles seems to be subsiding. People are driving about as much as they did in 1995 which is 9% lower then the peak in 2005. Some people may blame the lack of cars and driving on the reccession. On the other hand people were buying less cars two to three years befor the reccession even hit. If this pattern presists sociologist believe it will be eneficial for cabon emissions and the enviorment. This is becuase transpertation is the 2nd leading cause of carbon emission. This could have negitive effects on the automotive companies but they are already rebranding themselves as mobiltiy companies. This allows them to have a broder range of personal vehicles. Cities like New York have established a bike sharing program. This allows people access to bikes accross the city instead of taking a taxi. Many of the young people accross the country have not even bothered to get driver's liscenses. Driving decreased by 23% between years 2001 and 2009. They instead plan activites where they can walk or ride a bike.

The age of the car may be coming to an end. Communities have started promoting a car free life style. Made othe ways of transportation avaliable. The younger people in the community have quit driving all together. Wether becuase it is good for the enviorment or a choice they had to make becuase of the city they live in. Transpotation is evolving into a public affair, not a personal one. The automotive industry may take a hit but in the long run this could be beneficial for our planet. There will always be car buffs, but sooner rather then later, you may not own a car altogether.",1,d18ad070b494435cb4a48a5e66e0910c
"Drivers Should Not Use Cell Phones in Any Capacity While Operating a Vehicle

Operating a motor vehicle requires a driver's full attention at all times. However, with the rise of cell phone ownership, many drivers have begun using their phones even while driving. This dangerous distraction puts both the driver and other people on the road at risk of accident or injury. For this reason, drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity when driving.

There are several reasons why cell phone use while driving is too great a distraction. First, cell phones divert a driver's eyes from the road. Even brief glances away from the road to check a phone can cause a driver to miss important visual cues like traffic signals, pedestrians, or other vehicles. Second, cell phones divert a driver's mental focus and attention. Engaging in phone conversations, reading or sending texts or emails, or using apps all involve significant cognitive workload that removes much of a driver's attention from actually operating the vehicle. Numerous studies have found that driving while distracted by a phone is just as dangerous as - if not more dangerous than - driving while intoxicated. 

Allowing any cell phone use also opens the door for increasingly distracted behavior over time. Hands-free options like Bluetooth enable more lengthy phone conversations while driving, but conversations still divert mental focus. Texting while stopped at red lights could become more widespread and lead to multitasking even while driving. A total ban helps set a clear boundary that phones have no place in the driver's seat.

Instead of cell phone use, the safest option is for drivers to fully focus their eyes, hands, and mind on the task of driving. This protects not just the driver, but also other people sharing the road, whether in other vehicles, on bikes, or as pedestrians. A total ban on cell phone use while driving is prudent policy to help prevent accidents and promote public safety on our roads. Drivers should abstain from cell phone use until safely parked.",0,f6096b7abc05422f812b96688facb652
"This all started 21 years ago. Here is how the face on Mars was discovered. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars, taking pictures for possible landing sites for it's sister Viking 2 and it spotted a shadown of a likely human face. It was a great big head shaped face 2 miles apart from end to end. That is how this all started.

How could aliens make such a thing? There is no way. Some scientist believe that the face was an alien artifact, the photographing from Cydonia became a priorty for NASA when MGS showed up at the Red Planet in Sepmber. The face was not created by some things we like to call aliens that we don't even know if they exist or not, kind of like mermiads or unicorns.

There is to much evidence of how this face could of formed on it's own. It was so bi it would take aliens so long to even make this thing we say that looks like a face. Some people belive that the face is ""bona fide"", which means that that face is evidence that there was life on Mars at one point. Nobody has that big of a face for it to be an actual human face. I believe it is just a natual landform that just happened to look a lot like a human face. The face is exactly located 41 degrees North martian latitude where it was winter in April '98, a very cloudy time on the Red Planet. This investigation the scientist haas said has been very hard work to figure out exaclty what it is. I still belive with all the evidence we have it has to just be God's creation and it just apeared to look like a face, no aliens or anything like that because if you want to tell me that aliens did it you better be showing me that aliens even exist first.",1,e1873f11acf249d9877de2d87598a790
"In today's society, it is often argued that men are becoming more greedy and selfish. Some people believe that we should return to older, traditional values and show respect for family and local community. While I agree that traditional values are important, I do not believe that men are becoming more selfish and greedy. In this essay, I will explain my reasons for this opinion.

Firstly, it is important to recognize that traditional values are not always applicable to modern society. For example, in the past, women were expected to stay at home and take care of the children while men went out to work. However, in today's society, women have the same opportunities as men and can pursue careers if they choose to do so. Therefore, it is not always possible or desirable to return to traditional values.

Secondly, I do not believe that men are becoming more selfish and greedy. While there are certainly some men who exhibit these traits, there are also many men who are kind, generous, and compassionate. It is unfair to generalize all men as being selfish and greedy based on the actions of a few individuals.

Furthermore, I believe that it is important to recognize that society as a whole has become more individualistic. This is not just a problem among men, but among all people. In today's society, people are encouraged to pursue their own interests and goals, often at the expense of others. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it can lead to a lack of community spirit and a breakdown of traditional values.

In conclusion, while I agree that traditional values are important, I do not believe that men are becoming more selfish and greedy. It is important to recognize that traditional values are not always applicable to modern society and that society as a whole has become more individualistic. Instead of blaming men for this trend, we should work together to promote a sense of community and respect for others.

"For many people, their favorite part of summer is going to the beach. There's something special about feeling the sand between your toes and taking a dip in the cool ocean waters. Beyond just being a place for relaxation, however, there are numerous benefits that come with spending time at the beach. Firstly, visiting the beach can be great for both physical and mental health. Soaking up some much needed vitamin D from the sun or having an invigorating swim can help improve muscle tone while also boosting energy levels—which makes sense considering that saltwater is known as nature’s antidote to fatigue! Likewise, taking in beautiful views of rolling waves provides a calming effect on one’s thoughts and emotions which helps reduce stress levels over time. Whether it’s through participating in activities such as boogie-boarding or simply listening to crashing waves lapping against shoreline rocks—the beach offers unique ways for rejuvenation by connecting us more deeply with our natural environment. In addition to its soul-nourishing qualities, heading out to sea can promote exciting adventures that inspire creativity and learning opportunities for all ages! For example, collecting shells along nearby beaches teaches children about marine life conservation while simultaneously helping them recognize colors and shapes better; looking out into the horizon introduces budding young minds to astronomy basics; building sandcastles encourages architectural designs; searching tide pools allows teenagers access into studying biology (e.g., different types of crabs); snorkeling enables adults explore coral reefs & colorful fish habitats…and so much more! By engaging in these kinds of activities at least once during summer months (weather permitting), we get treated with fresh air education that cannot be found elsewhere apart from nature itself!. . All things considered, trips to sandy shores provide incomparable joy when enjoyed mindfully–for they offer not only temporary escapes but also long lasting lessons on how best appreciate our wondrous world around us through glorious days spent basking under sunshine

As they were taking pictures around Mars they were shocked to see a face on one of the pictures. Scientists didn't take to much consideration aout the face. Thye thought it was just another Martian mesa.

A few days later they released the picture of the face to the world. Since they released the photo it has become a pop icon. It was showed in Hollywood films, books, magazines, and in radio talks. Some people think it the Face is bona flide evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. The people thought they were hiding the fact that life may be on Mars.

On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera took some photos that were ten times sharper then the ones in 1976. As Michael Malin was taking photos, the world was anxious to see what would be the outcome of the photos. When the photos came out on a website it showed a landform. There was really no alien monument after all.

The Face of Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. It was a cloudy time of year on the Red planet. Not everyone was satisfied that it was just a landform. Some people say that the alien markings were hidden by all the haze. NASA decided to look aagain at Cydonia in 2001.

On April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor went to take another look at the landform. During that little exibition, Malin's team captured an extraordianry photo using the camera's maximun resolution. Each pixel in 2001 spans 1.5 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

They compared the three photos and came to conclusion that the picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, common landforms around the American West. Garvin said it reminds him most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa, about the same height as the Face on Mars. Some people are dissapointed that it wasn't a alien artifact, but people still have there hopes that it possibly could be one.",1,2c576ba157a446ef862af8c999546b39
"The world is becoming increasingly connected, and as a result, young people are more aware of the problems that exist beyond their immediate communities. While this is generally a good thing, it can sometimes lead to a feeling of disconnection from the community in which they live. This is especially true when young people see problems in their communities that they feel powerless to do anything about.

However, I do not agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. There are many young people who are deeply committed to making a difference in the world, and they are often the ones who are most effective at effecting change. This is because they have the energy and the idealism to really make a difference.

One example of this is the work that many young people are doing to combat climate change. Young people are at the forefront of the fight to raise awareness about the issue and to pressure governments and businesses to take action. They are also leading the way in developing innovative solutions to the problem.

Another example is the work that young people are doing to promote social justice. There are many young people who are deeply committed to fighting inequality and injustice, and they are often the most effective advocates for change.

So, while there are some young people who may not be as engaged with their communities as they could be, there are many others who are making a real difference.

"The role a car plays in the life of an individual has made changes through out the years. There never was a significant meaning to having a car it just meant having a vehicle that can get you from point A to point B. As the human society continues to progress with the creations of technology, the use of cars has diminished greatly in different parts of the world. Not being able to use a car seems like there is no bright side, but there are actually many advantages on limiting car usage.

The United States always had this recognition of being one of the world's prime car cultures. ""The first Model T cars were born in the U.S. It has also been the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized mustang Sally."" President Barack Obama identifies in the article, The End of Car Culture, his dreams for the U.S ""to curb the United State's geen house gas emissions will get a forturious assist from an incipent shift in American behavior."" Going back to the article as reference, studies show ""americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by... as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak... there was also a drop in percent of 16 to 39 year olds getting a license."" The cause of the downfall in car usage can be pointed towards a few factors internet making telecommuting possible, the renewal of center cities, and the rise of cellphones and carpooling apps. It is not because society assumes cars are becoming of no use, the role of technological improvements are making things a lot easier than how things were in the 1960's. The United states has the option of using cars or not, in other places like Paris, the option to drive has become a choice made out of a person's own power.

Paris, France is a location that anyone dreams of visiting. The city is beautiful but the levels of smog have made it impossible for people to enjoy the views of the city. According to the article, Paris bans driving due to smog , ""it has been enforced to the citizens of a partial driving ban in order to clear the air... people were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine which is 31 in the United States."" The way things are organized in Paris goes by a person's license plate number. In correlation to the article, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifiying smog."" However, not all of the cars used in Paris, France were banned. Those cars that are plugins, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers were allowed to roam the street of Paris. A good majority, 67 percent, of vehicles in France are made up of diesel, and that kind of fuel were the ones to blame since gasoline was not in favor in a city like that one. In the same way, places like Bogota, Colombia, had similar situations as the peolpe that live in France.

In the country of Colombia there has been a day dediated to doing things with no car it's a carfree day. In contrast to how banning driving is in Paris, Bogota, Colombia has everyone participate in this 24 hour event. If a person were to violate the rule they are to face 25 fines. The article, Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, explains that ""millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during the carfree day."" Just like the goals in Paris, Colombia has goals to promote alternatice transportation and reduce smog. A businessman, Carlos Arturo Plaza, explains ""it's good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" No one would everythink that driving is as stressful as going to work. When put into mind, things begin to make sense. The early mornings of road rage people encounter makes their entire day a little more stressful than what it should be. Driving is a wonderful advantage but there is always more than just a car. Colombia's main goal, as expressed in the article ""is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" In the end of it all cars have always been in the making trying to find new ways to improve and modernize. Although cars may have had significant meanings in the older times, as society continues to prosper in technological making, cars are beginning to be identified as material objects that are not as important. They are just in use for people to get from one place to the next when other things are not working.",1,37ade7ff2ac74124ab72a339928e185c
"Phones and Driving

Over the years, phones and other technology have taken over the lives of society. They have become a major necessity to society. People go everywhere with them and it often feels as though you've lost a child of you don't have it with you.

Although phones are of great use to every human being there are also a major drawback. People do not know how to discipline themselves to put away their phones, especially while they're driving in a vehicle.

Drivers should not be able to use their cellphones while driving.

On any given day, about 660,000 americans will attempt to use their phones while in a vehicle according to FFC.

According to CDC, texting and driving caused a whopping nine deaths and over 500 injuries in the year of 2018. One out of four car crashes are caused by texting and driving. Many studies have shown that texting while driving doubles the chance of getting into an accident. The obsession of phones have caused way too many casualties than needed.

Many laws have been established to prevent the rise of deaths caused by texting and driving. About sixteen states including the U.S. ban all hand-held cell phone use , while others have placed restrictions regarding cell phones. Some states like, Connecticut,

Georgia , New Jersey, and Maryland have placed penalties or fines for people that are texting while driving. These laws and penalties have shown to be pretty effective, the rates of casualties due to cell phone use have gone down tremendously.

People in this society should also research ways to help them prevent the usage of the phones while driving. People all over the world should take their lives more seriously.

Answering a text, taking a video for snapchat, whatever the case may be should not be the cause of their fatal death.

"For many years people have been debating whether or not to keep the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. According to source 1, the electoral college was established as ""a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" There are few positive effects of the Electoral College, however, there are many negative effects. I am in favor of changing the United States' election process to election by popular vote because there are many risks with the Electoral College, the Electoral College is outdated, and lastly, the Electoral College is unfair to voters in many states.

Currently, while using the Electoral College, the United States takes multiple risks. Some of the major risks were stated in source two. One of the major risks included, what of the elector put the vote in for the candidate he wished? Of course no matter what the situation, there will be risks to take. However, when those risks become actions, and happen more than once, people put up a guard and start to question whether or not the process is trustworthy. A sentence in source three declared, ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. Americans are expected to trust a slate of electors whom we know little about personally, and trust is a personal thing. Trust is something that has to be earned. Therefore, when our trust is betrayed more than once because of the process the Electoral College, there is no way to earn that trust back once again. Without the Electoral College, this would not be an issue.

Not only is the Electoral College risky, but it is also outdated. The Electoral College was created by the founding fathers, over a century ago. With new technology, and new systems forming, the election process should be more modern. Also, when it was decided to use the Electoral College, there were fewer people in the United States. Currently, in modern day, the population is much greater. A country with a greater population needs a modern election selection.

The Electoral College is very unfair to states that do not have the ability to make an impact in the election. If the election process were changed to elected by popular vote, smaller states would have the ability to make their vote matter.

The Electoral College needs to be changed immediately in able for citizens to stop worrying about taking major risks, so our country as more of a modern election process, and so every vote counts. Changing to election by popular vote could make the United States a better country.",1,0543cf73289d419195b192396b378d4b
"Vroom! Vroom! Is the familiar and common sound heard all across the world. Can you believe that cars can be so helpful and convienient, yet cause so many problems? The United States, Environmental Protection Agency, jumped on board with it's new promotion of, ""car reduced"" communities. This is a new act that will limit car usage, and help protect our Earth's environment. Motorits all over the world are contributing to the Greenhouse effect, stress, congestion, and pollution in the air we breathe. Countries such as, Columbia, France, and Germany are trying to reduce pollution, and the long term affects of cars have on the world.

Middle-class families, ranging from Chicago to Shanghai, make a huge impact on our greenhouse. Up to about fifty percent in the US alone emits carbon dioxide gas, instead of trying to reduce it. According to the international agency headquarters in London, the congestion and traffic within the capital of France, went down sixty percent, after fining citizens for being on the road after five days of a near-record pollution. The smog that covered this global city had one hundred fourty seven microorganisms per cubic meter. They had blamed diesel fuel as the reason for the smog. The cold nights and warm days trapped car emissions. If we started this new idea, we would see a large improvement within our enviromnment.

Beep! Beep! Traffic is such a stressful situation to be in. Wheather it is on your way to work, going home, getting lunch, or going to see a friend, the streests are flooded. This new act will promote the simplicity of transportation. This will release a lot of stress on people, and make their lives happier and healthier. People will be more connected and involved with their community and surroundings. Sidewalks are being layed out all throught cities, for people to find a new efficient way of transportation such as, walking or riding a bike.

Some countries are so used to not having a car or even having a space to put a vehicle. In Vauban, Germany, people are giving their cars up more and more. They just see the positive affects this ""car-free"" act has on them. Today seventy percent of families that live there do not own cars. The rate of people getting their license has gone down dramaticlly as well. Car companies are scared for their business if everyone tries to conserve energy.

This limitation of moterized vehichles may be just what the world needs to improve it's environment. This saves more energy, reduces pollution, keeps people healthy and stressfee. Living a life of simplicity will make you more happier.",1,bd15b99ca0114f56a73d985d374e969e
"Schools offer different options of schooling, they have is Online School , Public School , Private School and also Video Conferencing . However taking classes from home wouldn't benefit students the same way Public School would benefit them due to the fact; Some students are visual learners, Students wouldn't have a big social life outside of their home , Students can slack on their own education an have no motivation and also they could be relying on Google answers when they don't understand the material.

Students have different methods to remembering a material they have learned. Everyone isnt the same, Everyone has their own different techniques; Some people may be visual learners, They need someone to be speaking to them explaining step by step and some students just like peace and quite to figure it out on their own. Personally I am a visual learner for every subject, I would need my teachers to give examples and to go over everything to me step by step to learn the material the teacher is teaching. My classmate, Generic_Name has a different opinion, Generic_Name needs a quite place to concentrate and to think about his work rather than a teacher talking the whole class period.

In Elementary , Middle school and High school they plan a lot of activities for the kids. Schools have dances, concerts and even field trips being home schooled you wouldn't be able to enjoy none of the fun activities the school would have planned for your classmates. Being home schooled you wouldn't have that "" high school experience "" everyone claims they love so much and would do anything to go back too. Being home school would also effect your social life for the real world. In school they might not have a class for communication but going to a Public schools does teach you how to speak up and communicate with other people you dont know and that would really be beneficial for the real world after school when you go into your career.

On the weekend I personally hate doing homework, I like to think of my home as a lazy environment for myself rather than another school place. I think if kids were to be home schooled they wouldn't be able to concentrate at home the whole time they are supposed to. There would be no consequences for the student as if when they aren't paying attention or just on their phones the whole time. There would be no teachers or administrators to be motivating the student to get to work, be on time or even get your'e grades up. Being home schooled and doing online school they would start getting on the wrong track after some time. If my house for me was a school environment i would procrastinate my school work so much like saying "" ill do it in 15 minutes "" "" ill do it the next 15 minutes "" and so on to the point i forgot because i have no motivation for my work.

Having no teachers or administrator around it would be easy to cheat. not understanding the material and not being able to ask questions your last resort is to cheat for answer. Students will find the answers then think they have a easy way out of online school by relying on Google answers. Students can also pay someone to be doing their work for them and manipulate other kids to agree and do the work for them. Students attending online school or homeschooling have a lot of ways to cheat for their classwork.

I disagree that home school or online school would be beneficial for students because they wouldn't be able to learn and understand everything and to being able to ask questions, Students wouldn't have a social life outside of their home and not be prepared to communicate with people outside in the real world, Students would't have any motivation for their school work and start slacking off and lastly they can find easy ways to get out of their own work and having it done without them actually doing any work.

"""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" is an article about a natural landform on Mars that some people believe to be created by aliens. The Face has been scientifically proven to just be a landform called a butte or mesa. According to the article, some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, which is evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. I think this is illogical because in the article it states that defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars. I am here today to support the idea that the Face is just a natural landform.

One fact to support the claim that the Face is just a natural landform is in the article. In the article it says that some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars that NASA is just trying to hide. If this were true why would defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars? They would not! That is why I believe the idea of the life on Mars to be illogical.

A second fact to support the claim that the Face is just a natural landform is in the article too. In the article it says that the first picture of the Face was taken in 1976, back when photo quality was not so exceptional. In the 1976 picture of the Face, I understand that it does look like a face, but in the 1998 picture the quality has became a lot better and it does not look as much like a face. Then again in 2001, there was another picture taken of the Face. In the 2001 picture of the Face, the quality has again risen and distinctively shows that the landform does not look like a face and is just a butte or mesa.

A third fact to support the claim that the Face is just a natural landform is again, in the article. In the article it says that the Face has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! I think this is why many people believe in all sorts of different conspiracies, because there all kinds of different books and more written about different beliefs. Today, people believe anything they read in a book or see on tv, that is also why I believe this. Who would you rather believe, books, stuff on tv, and other things, or scientifically proven facts?

In my opinion, it does not matter what you believe, but I support the truth. I would rather believe in the science, not people's opinions. Would you? If you want to be the logical person, you would be able to comprehend that the Face is just a natural landform. Scientifically proven information or opinions, pick your side.",1,1d8656b2b55b4696b1d0f3d3435c78c9
"In the past few years, cellphones have become a major use of communication for many people. Cellphones has become a major issue in the field of driving. Many people drive while they're on the cellphone. The use of cellphones while driving should be banned. I say this because there have been 60-70% of drivers that have died, crashed due to the fact that they are using their cellphones while driving.

To begin with, the use of cellphones while driving should be stopped. In the last few years there have been many car crashes because people are all into their phones when they overall focus should be driving. At times cellphones can be of good use. But not all the time. People use cellphones to help them get to and from but they shouldn't be used all the time.

According to the law of Tennessee, ""banning hand-held cellphone use while driving takes effect July 1"". ""Beginning July 1, the drivers could face a major fine up to $200 for using their cellphones while driving"". This should be banned in the state of Georgia, because the drivers don't realize how much damage they're causing when they are on their cellphones.

In conclusion, cellphones should be banned. They should not be used while driving. If people want to avoid getting into accidents they should stop using their phones while driving. If there weren't any accidents the world would be a safer place. Having cellphones can be of good use as well. But only if people use them that way. Making a phone call while driving can be dangerous as well. Making phone calls aren't always that important. So therefore banning cellphones while driving could result in a better solution.",1,5065b55310b94ec98900df8561f0171c
"The use of this technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because many students have a hard time in school and with this technology computers could learn whether or not a student is mad, happy, sad, etc. Just from a computer screen reading their facial expressions. So if a student is happy and smiles at a computer screen an ad will pop up but if you then frown, the next ad will be different.

In the article it talks about a classroom computer that could recognize when a student is bored or confused, Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" If the computer could do that more students wouldn't be bored anymore because of the computer reading the student's expression,Which would keep kids interested in their school work. Which could keep more kids in school and would lead to higher education and more graduated students every year.

With this technology scientists could study how kids emotions get them when they are at home, school, etc. Which could lead to more better info about kids when they are at different locations. The Facial Action Coding System is very important because It can judge emotions and can keep people happy It has to be valuable.",1,16d7b1d1ce2d43b09157731a308f84ce
"
Showing kindness is an integral part of being a good person, and one that brings many benefits to both the giver and the receiver. When we give of our time, resources, or simply a kind word, we lift the spirits of those around us and bring joy to their day. Kindness can be shown in many forms; small kindnesses, like holding the door open for someone, smiling at a passerby on the sidewalk, and helping a neighbor with a task, can make an immense difference.

Kindness is self-serving too—it can brighten our own mood, create feelings of satisfaction and even boost our mood. We can feel a sense of purpose, and of being part of something larger than ourselves, when we give of ourselves voluntarily. Moreover, kind acts often lead to genuine relationships, further prospering the atmosphere around us. Being kind helps promote our mental and emotional well-being as it enables us to be more resilient and helps combat stress.

In a world where negative news stories are pervasive, making an effort to show kindness can help change the course of our day for ourselves and those around us. It is a simple yet powerful act that can have profound impacts. Giving of ourselves, in whatever capacity, pays off in the end; simply taking a moment to be kind to someone means we can be part of something greater. Therefore, the importance of showing kindness should not be underestimated.",0,1cf8ea7262834515bfcf793700c45d7b
"The Challenge of Exploring Venus as the author suggested to study is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it can happen. The reason Humens should explore the Unknown Venus is becuase it was the closest planet to Earth terms of density and size. Venus is dangers for a humen to explore but not an unman spacecraft to go near the surface. Venus is tricky and challanging to explore becuase of the high temeratures that average 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the Atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Even though Mercury is the closet to our sun.

On the depths of the surface of Venus there is alot going on, as in erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightign strikes. Scientists are already discussing how to visit the Venus surface which means they also want to explore and study Venus. Venus once have been like Earth-like planet in our solar system. It has some land features if rocky sediment, Valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus is sometimes our nearest option for a planetary visit, given the long time frames of space travel. The Value of returning to venus seems unlikly.

NASA is creating a blimp-like vehicle to hover 30 or more miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. The almost easy task for the vehicle would use solar power becuase the sun would be above it all the time. Even in high altitude the climate is still pretty hot that is around 170 degree Fahrenheit. The downfall to being so high up above 30 or more miles is not much research will go on becuase the limited view we well get. More importantly is that scientist can't get samples of rocks, gases, and anything else since the spacecraft will be high up.

Scientist is now looking at old technology called mechanical computers. The ""old Technology"" uses gear and levers but not electronics at all. Modern computers are more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. mechanical parts are more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces then a computer. What I think is that Venus is worth the pursuit despite the danger it can bring. Venus does have value to be explored because who doesn't love a challenge? I sure do love a challenge.",1,47a3f21a3c0d4821bc4b78af6afef125
"This new technology can really figure out if youre happy, sad, fearful, mad, or confuse. I would really enjoy this new technolgy. I even think that we should have it in our classrooms. This can really change us in school and better educated.

I believe that we should have the Facial Action Coding System. If we were in our classroom, the teacher can't sometimes tell if your really happy, bored, mad, or sad. If you learning something in class and the computer shows that youre bored. The can help you get motivated and try harder on your homework. Sometimes students comes in and just smile, but really you don't really know how they feeling. On paragraph 8, its says that sometimes there face isn't saying the truth becuase deep down there hurn or just lying. There trying to hide there emotions. The teachers really need to how they feeling. Like in paragraph 6, it says that it can detect if a students was feeling bored, sad, fearful. What if they were depressed or mad at something? We have to do something and help them. This can really benifent our school and our students.

I would really value this computer system, becuase it can help our education better and more efficient. We need to know how there feeling what can we do to help them. I would really recommend this in our school. Facial Action Coding System would really benefient our classroom.",1,b420743c23e64b1f84bc32bbbf359966
"Automobiles have proved to be very convenient to our modern day society. It allows people to travel 20 miles in ten to fifteen minutes. By foot, it would take about four hours to travel that distance. Although cars have been beneficial, the limitation of car usage would outweigh the benefits of constantly relying on them. Decreasing the amount of time we spend in them would improve public transportation, improve air quality, and create less stress.

Cutting down the amount of car usage would encourage the use of public transportation. According to Source 1, the essentially carless suburban, Vanbaun, has made public transportation more accessible. Increasing the use of it would decrease the time it takes to commute from place to place. Less cars on the roads mean less traffic. In small towns, not as many people currently use the system on a regular basis. With the limiting of car usage, public transportation could become more popular in suburban areas, not just metropolitan cities. Some may not want to take this form of transportation because it may not meet their sanitary needs. However, if the popularity increases, cities will be obligated to improve the conditions. Public transportation could be the new primary form of transportation if we limit the amount of time cars are allowed to be used.

Additionally, a large problem in the world today is air pollution and global warming. Automobiles cause the majority of this ongoing problem. Less time spent in the car would eventually lead to better air quality. Source 2 states that in Paris, France the smog in the city was nearrecord pollution. This caused Paris to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air. Congestion was cut down 60% after this action was taken. Vehicles release numerous harmful greenhouse gases that we have been trying to reduce. These gases not only harm the environment, but the people as well. New and popular alternatives to the common diesel cars are hybrids and electric cars. Less car usage would result in reduction of pollution.

Also, using a car less decreases stress levels. According to Source 3, in Bogota, Colombia, citizens participate in the very popular carfree day. A businessman in Colombia said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress."" Cars do not allow people's mind to stop and rest. A driver's mind is constantly thinking and attempting to get to their destination as fast as possible. If cars were barely used, people could take a serene stroll to their destination, allowing the mind to slow down, think, and relax. Parks and recreation would expand and improve as well due to the smaller vicinity we can reach by foot or bike. New and improved public areas would become more enjoyable, making us less stressed. Stress levels decline as car usage declines.

The increased use of public transportation, improved air quality, and lower stress levels all result from the limitations of car usage. As beneficial as a car may be to people, limiting the use of it is more advantageous than not. Car companies are still widely developing as highways and roads are expanding, but our society should go the other direction and find healthier sources of transportation.",1,d417fc68eb6f4c5c9921952d1387ec69
"I'm telling you it's not!!! The Face is only a mesa. They have pictures as proof .The Face is just a landformation an alien race did not make it.

The Face is a plain old mesa. The reason it looks like a face is because of unusal shadows. Then NASA used a high resoultion camera and saw it was just a landformation. Also Cydonia is an area with mesas.

They have multiple pictures of the Face. They releasaed them to the public saying it was a landformation. If it wasn't they wouldn't have told the public. Also in the pictures you can see that it's not a face.

Others say that the Face was made by aliens. They say that the photos weren't clear enough and that NASA is trying to hide the ancient alien civiliazation. However, they took much more clear photos . Also if there was an ancient alien civilization NASA would be happy and would tell the world because it would benefit them.

The Face is just a mesa not created by aliens. They have photogenic proof. The Face is just a natural landformation. I'm telling you it was not made by aliens!!!",1,273d91c5519348e2bd61b6374529abcb
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to urge you to reconsider our country's current use of the Electoral College system. After deep investigation and consideration, I have found that most voters, myself included, would instead prefer a direct election.

In our status quo, as established by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College process comprises of elector selection, meetings, and vote counting by Congress. Each state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of its Congressional delegation members. However, this process has its flaws, as stated by Bradford Plumer in his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College."" In his plight for a change to direct vote, he argues that the Electoral College system is both non-democratic and confusing, leading potentially to electoral ""disasters."" In fact, electors have historically flouted public opinion and voted according to their own whim, which undermines democratic principles.

Opponents of the direct vote system argue that the Electoral College offers ""certainty of outcome,"" encourages candidates to have a ""trans-regional appeal,"" and ensures that more ""thoughtful voters"" will decide elections, as Judge Richard A. Posner pointed out in his essay ""In Defense of the Electoral College."" While these are seemingly valuable benefits, they do not sufficiently counterbalance the principle of fairness that our democracy should uphold. More fundamentally, it does not sit well with a vast majority of people that someone can win the most popular votes and still lose the presidency. 

In addition, the Electoral College seems to exacerbate the gap between different states' political influence. As it stands, candidates tend to pay more attention to larger states and swing states, leaving lesser populous states feeling neglected, which contradicts the principle of equality that a democratic nation should cherish. Consequently, the system favors some voters over others, as Plumer explained. 

The arguments against the Electoral College system align more consistently with our democratic ideals than the arguments in favor of maintaining it. As the matters stand, the Electoral College system feels outdated and disjointed from the transformation our society has experienced since it was established. 

I appeal to you to advocate on our behalf to maintain our country's integrity by replacing this flawed system with a direct voting system, which would foster a more accurate representation of our citizenry in the election of our President.

Yours sincerely,
[Your name]",0,3af84e4ea61042a9bc72d1d344c0b18d
"The electoral college, a mistake? Many Americans are unsatisfied with the electoral college and the system it follows. The electoral college has disappointed millions of Americans of any social class. According to The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , by Bradford Plummer, "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of the electors, who in turn elect the president."" America should abolish the electoral college as it has upset 60 percent of americans and elected unwanted Presidents.

""This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency"", as said by Bradford Plummer. Every year Americans fall stricken by disappointment from the electoral college. The system of the electoral college is a poor representation of american ideals as candidates do not even bother spending time in nonswing states. According to Bradford Plummer, in the 2000 campaign seventeen states did not even see the candidates at all and 25 percent of the largest media markets did not even see a single campaign ad. As previously proven, the electoral college must be abolished due to the unfairness of its system.

The electoral college believers say that the electoral college stops disaster from happening, this is false. As Americans vote they vote for a slate of electors, which definitely creates a loss of the opposing or minority votes. This is because of the winnertakesall system that the electoral college runs off of. When the majority of the votes is accounted for, the minority votes are basically thrown away in a sense. Also, the electoral college ruins the chance of a more correct voting experience for old and new voters, making Americans ashamed and unwilling to vote because of the feeling of their vote meaning nothing or perhaps being crippled by the electoral college.

When the founding fathers of America created the electoral college it was an age without technology, making the electoral college a grand idea. Long ago, the electoral college served a patriotic and noble purpose as their was no technology and much less people. In todays age of technology, the record keeping and election process could not get any better as long as the electoral college is abolished and never reincarnated. The electoral college abolishes individual votes for the majority, crippling the American voting experience and smuthering it in shame and disappointment. The electoral college is outdated in many ways and should be dismissed from America.

In conclusion, the electoral college is shaming Americans from every state. This system should be permanantly abolished becuase of its lack of fairness and reliability. Every American vote should count just as much as its opposing vote instead of being dismissed. Free the vote and let the electoral college be forever dismissed of its dutys.",1,9bc91b8ee62e46678290f3d09429ed0f
"The history of lobsters is a fascinating one. For hundreds of years, the lobster has been an important source of sustenance for people living near coastal areas. Native Americans were among the first to recognize and harvest this tasty crustacean from its natural habitat in rocky ocean bottoms. Over time, they developed methods to trap and store them as part of their elaborate fishing practices. Today, lobsters are served all over the world as a delicacy or staple in many cultures. In North America, it is sometimes eaten boiled or steamed but can also be enjoyed grilled or even cold with mayonnaise on salads and sandwiches like lobster rolls. They are especially popular during summer months when fresh catches make their way into seafood markets across the continent. In addition to being delicious and nutritious, lobsters have some uniquely interesting characteristics that set them apart from other sea creatures: they have no true bones which makes them incredibly light weight; they possess antennae-like claws which help them find food; and some species live upwards of 50 years! This remarkable lifespan means that certain individuals can actually grow large enough to be immortalized by fishermen who give these giants names like ""Lobster Larry"" or ""Big Red"". . Humans have long had an appreciation for this creature's unique abilities and appeal - so much so that it has become a symbol associated with luxury dining experiences throughout history! From ancient Rome where wealthy citizens enjoyed lavish feasts featuring delicate dishes made from freshly caught lobsters - to modern day New England where locals gather around big pots at clambakes every year - it is clear why this iconic animal continues to captivate us today!

"Dear state senator,

Everyone has their own opinion on whether or not you should keep the Electoral College or if you should change the election to popular votes for the president of the United States. My opinion is that you should change the election to the popular votes.

To begin with, The Electoral College is a process. In the article ""Does the Electoral College work?"" it states that ""the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" The Electoral College process consists of picking the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and the vice president and then the counting of the electoral votes by congress.

Next, The Electoral College has a few things wrong with it. In 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency to George W. Bush because Bush recieved 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266 electoral votes. Over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now. When voting you don't even get to vote for the president. You vote for a slate of electors. It would be nice to actually be able to vote for who you want to be president. The Electoral College is unfair, outdated and irrational.

Also, If you were to change to the popular vote, it would be fair. Everyone would get to put in their opinion on who should be the president of the United States. I think that if everyone was to be able to individually vote for their president, there would be less chaos and arguements about the election and also the new president. But, it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote won't win the national popular vote. But, it is very rare. Some people don't bother voting because of the fact that their vote will have no effect. They have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.

In conclusions, I think that changing to the popular vote instead of keeping the Electoral College would be the best thing for the united states. Everyones vote will count, it would be fair, and more people would pay attention to the elections and vote. Like Bob Dole said, ""Abolish the Electoral College!""

Sincerly, a concerned student.",1,a3ed20898ad344f5add46d88ecd898b3
"It is undeniable that technology has had a major impact on our lives, particularly over the last decade. This can be seen in the increasing presence of digital devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers within homes, classrooms, and workplaces. But what about its role in education? How have developments in technological infrastructure affected learning and teaching practices?. The introduction of online platforms such as Blackboard or Moodle was an early example of how technology could revolutionize the educational process by allowing teachers to post assignments or lecture notes at any time on any device. This enabled students to access information from anywhere with just a few clicks. In addition, it allowed for more efficient communication between teachers and their pupils - enabling effective feedback loops which helped to improve student experience and performance. Furthermore, these systems provided secure spaces where students could work together on projects without having to worry about internet security concerns - something that was not possible before. Another way that technology has impacted education is through its ability to provide greater accessibility for those who are unable or unwilling to attend traditional classroom-based instruction. Distance learning courses enable individuals from all walks of life - including those living in remote areas or even different countries –to benefit from formal education regardless of location or financial constraints. Similarly, online study groups allow likeminded people around the world connect and collaborate on projects at any time – providing further opportunities for global collaboration outside traditional schooling environments. Technology also offers new possibilities for assessment; recent advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) grading tools are proving beneficial for both learners and educators alike - freeing up valuable teacher time while ensuring accuracy with data driven decisions based upon large datasets collected during assessments .This helps ensure fairness across all assessments which provides consistency throughout various exams given by different institutions/ schools etc., thus improving overall academic standards globally. Additionally this type of AI system allows instructors/professors /teachers more insight into understanding exactly what areas each student excels at so they can better focus their efforts towards helping them

"This technology would be useful in many ways. This technology could be very valuable, but it also could be too much for us to handle.

With technology like this it might make learning things online more interesting.

Imagine reading a boring documentory about a hero you are writing about for class, as you continue to read the article, a suggested website pops up with interesting facts about your person with more information.

Now you are more interested and the computer has done its job to change your feelings on this presentation.

We could use this technology to do many other similar things like that.

Maybe one day you are just down in the dumps and all these videos you are watching are just making you feel worse and even more bored than before.

Then a suggested video pops up and you are able to watch it and laugh and it was able to take your horrible day and turn it into just another good day.

These are the nice things this kind of technology can do for us.

Although you might think it is strange to have a computer know exactly how you are feeling when you sit down at in front of it.

There would never be a dull moment in front of the computer though.

Maybe you are just sitting around and you get bored and have nothing better to do so you get up and you make your way to the computer and play with the emotion detector just by making faces at your computer seeing if it can guess how you are feeling.

Technology is advancing quick, it is nothing like it used to be, but either you have to run with it or get ran over.

Things are changing fast we have to change with them.

This is why this technology is so valuable, we can use it in many ways even if its not important.

We can still get use out of it, so why not make it a thing? In the article it says ""She is 83 percent happy, 9 percent digusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry"" talking about the Mona Lisa painting.

Now you cant tell me that that is not cool at all.

Its pretty amazing what they can do with technology these days so we might as well adjust to it instead of push it away.

That is why we should be able to have technology like this.",1,866dd251716548adbb11730ca04ebbc7
"Albert Einstein said "" Imagination is more important that knowledge"" do I agree with Albert Einstein or do i disagree I picked agree and I'm going to tell you why I picked it.

Reason one imagination is all about being creative like thinking about stuff to do and stuff to wear and writing a song you got to use your imagination and speaking you got to use your imagination just to know what your about to say before you even say the word.

Reason two Albert Einstein used his imagination to be really smart and creative. Also people who invented stuff they used their imagination and not only that they made millions just by using there imagination, and construction workers got to use there own imagination just to construct a big buildings and houses.

Reason three you can make money from just using your imagination I seen people make lots of money just selling stuff they made at there own homes and seen so many companies go from not making anything like money to being this really large company that made millions just from using there imagination.

And thats why i agree with Albert Einstein saying ""Imagination is more important than knowledge""",1,8a737ebbd24f4f4abc621647a40b7a0a

"limiting car usage is an advantage for many reasons, for example, the pollution will become less of a problem, people will be less tense, and we will be devoid of traffis jams, which means less car accidents. To me cars are just something to get you to point A to B, but now that I have read these articles I  realize that cars are alot wrose for the enviroment then i thought, and that i should try using of ways of transportation.

In the passage it states ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" The pollution was out of control and for the most part it was because of the huge amount of car usage. The effect of banning car usage was resulting in an amazing outcome, less pollution, which is healthier for the commuitty. The advantage of limiting car usage can effect a whole commuitty and one way is less pollution. Bogota, Colombia had the same idea but they were not banning the car usage they have one day called the car-free day to show that its an advantage not to use cars all the time.

Limiting car usage can even make you less tense, as said in the article,"" ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way,""said Heidrum Walter, a media trainerand mother of two, as she walker verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering childern drown out the occasional distant motor."" Everything is better when car usage is limited it, makes you less tense and less pollution."" "" Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.""

When there is less cars on the road there is less possiblity of car accidents or traffic jams."" ... leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" During the one day of no car usage, the streets were left of no traffic jams or accidents. The world is a better place with limited car usage. "" Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""

To conclude, the limited car usage is a great way to reduce the amount of pollution, become less tense , and creat less possibility to have car accidents or road jams. After reading these article I have realized that taking othe transportations like bicycle or on foot could have huge impacts on the enviroment and my own well being.",1,ee5bee31148043ab82f20913c37fa702
"The topic of this essay is the impact of international travel on global health. International travel has been increasing steadily over the past several decades, and with it comes a number of health risks for those who choose to explore other countries. There are many potential threats that travelers may face when visiting different parts of the world, from food-borne illnesses to infectious diseases, but there are also positive impacts that can come from traveling abroad as well. One way in which international travel affects global health is through its ability to spread communicable diseases from one country or region to another. As more and more people visit foreign destinations they bring their own germs and bacteria with them, which can then be shared among others once they have arrived at their final destination. Cases such as SARS in 2003 and H1N1 influenza in 2009 demonstrate how quickly infectious diseases can reach new places via air travel. Even though outbreaks such as these can cause significant disruption among populations in impacted areas, increased awareness about hygiene practices around food and water consumption can help minimize the risk posed by travelers spreading infections or viruses into populated regions elsewhere on earth. In addition to helping spread disease across borders, international travel has also had a positive effect on global healthcare by allowing access to treatments that would not otherwise be available within certain countries’ domestic markets. This includes medical tourism where patients seek out specialised care overseas due to unavailability where they reside – particularly if costs associated with treatment back home become too expensive or prohibitively difficult for individuals lacking access resources like insurance coverage or adequate salaries – while simultaneously driving down prices by introducing competition into what would otherwise be a closed market domestically (depending on regulations). Moreover, visitors often bring new ideas related to managing certain conditions along with them: whether it’s investigative techniques adopted during routine checkups or innovative therapies learned whilst receiving treatment abroad–allowing practitioners back home reap benefits similar knowledge dissemination traditionally found within professional circles heretofore hampered by physical distance between peers geographically separated

"The author has great supports about why we should study the planet of Venus. He called it Earth's twin. He stated that Venus is the closest planet to be comapred to Earth. The author states that blimp-like vehicles would help with the study of Venus.

The author said Venus is Earth's twin because it's the closest planet to have the same density and size as Earth. The author states that we could use blimp-like vehicles to not get burnt or crushed because if the vehicle gets 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape everything would change. The temperature would drop from about 800 degress to 170 degress Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure would drop from 90 times greater than earths surface to about Earth's sea level if the vehicle were to be 30 miles or so above the surface.

All you need to know why we need to study Venus more is all here. Venus is basically Earth's twin so why not study it more. Venus is the closet planet to be compared to Earth with its size and density. Blimp-like vehicles would help with it's flight to 30 miles or so. It would help with the temperature and the atmospheric pressure. Do you have anything to debate about these facts?",1,44f623f7389f4b42a448949fa18b8c2c

When it comes to forming relationships, making first impressions is essential. People often form impressions of each other within seconds of meeting. This includes judging things such as clothing, hairstyle, body language, and the tone used in conversation. It's easy to make a first impression, but it can be challenging to change that impression afterwards. 

When navigating a situation like this, one strategy is to find reasons to have a second conversation. This gives another chance to make a favorable impression. Achieving a successful connection is all about finding common ground and showing genuine interest in the other person. 

For example, one student was able to change her first impression on an interviewer after an initial conversation went badly. She researched the interviewer, identified common interest, and prepared thoughtful questions to get the conversation flowing. She made sure to not only remain engaged throughout the conversation, but also demonstrate her knowledge of the field. 

Finally, although making a positive impression is important, it is also important to remember that it is not everything. Do not put too much focus or attention into a first impression as it can limit the mutual understanding that comes from further conversation. It is also important to remember that everyone makes mistakes and should be given chances to redeem themselves. ",0,ec494f43e1534bb996b17242f9815d58

Recently, our school has decided to make some changes to the food served in the cafeteria for lunch. While I understand the desire to provide healthier choices to the students, I believe that there are serious drawbacks to the new food that have not been considered. 

For one, I feel that the new food is not as appetizing or enjoyable as the old menu. The students are no longer able to purchase the things they like, and the meals taste bland and unappetizing. Additionally, the portions are small and the variety is lacking, meaning students are often left feeling unsatisfied and hungry. 

The new food has not only changed the taste of the meals, but also the atmosphere in the cafeteria. With less appealing food, the noise level has decreased as fewer students come to eat together and socialize. 

In conclusion, although I understand the motivation behind the change, I do not feel that it has been beneficial to the student body. The lack of variety, small portions, and unappealing taste makes me question the decision to change the lunch menu.",0,22764e3567544ec6a6dafc1302923368
"One of the most important skills of English for Chinese learners is still largely debated. While some people think that reading should be given priority, others argue that speaking should be emphasized instead. In my opinion, speaking should be given priority over reading for Chinese learners.

To begin with, speaking English is essential for Chinese learners as it allows them to connect with native speakers and gain a better understanding of the language. Speaking English gives Chinese learners the opportunity to practice the language in real-time, as it requires them to apply the knowledge they have acquired from their reading. Speaking also allows Chinese learners to interact with native English speakers and learn the nuances of the language, such as slang and idioms, that are difficult to pick up from simply reading. In this way, Chinese learners will be able to express themselves accurately and confidently in English.

Moreover, speaking English is a more practical skill as it is used more frequently than reading. For example, when Chinese learners are travelling abroad, they will need to be able to converse with native speakers to get directions and ask for help. In addition, many professions require the ability to speak English, so learning to speak the language is important if the learners want to pursue their career.

Finally, speaking English is essential for Chinese learners to build confidence. As they practice and improve their speaking skills, they will be able to engage in conversations with more ease and feel more confident about speaking the language. This, in turn, will make them more motivated to continue learning the language and improve their fluency.

In conclusion, although reading is important for Chinese learners, speaking should be given priority over reading. Speaking English allows them to gain a better understanding of the language, be more practical and build their confidence.

The question of implementing a four-day school week with extended hours for primary and secondary schools in the United States is complex. Proponents of the scheme point out that it could save schools money on staff and transportation, as well as reducing absences and tardiness. Additionally, the extended days could give students more time for collaborative projects, experiential learning, and individualized instruction. 

On the other hand, opponents worry that the extended days could be difficult for working parents to manage, and that student learning could suffer if teachers are unable to cover the same amount of content in fewer days. Additionally, lower-income students could be disproportionately impacted, as they are less likely to have access to childcare and other academic resources outside of school.

Balancing these concerns, it appears that a four-day school week with extended hours is likely to be beneficial in some cases, such as rural communities or schools with tight budgets. However, extensive research should be done to ensure the implementation of such a scheme does not negatively impact student learning or access to education for all students.",0,276208d5ca674c95b8d55353d65f33d0
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my view that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to electing the president by popular vote. While the Electoral College system was established to avoid ""the tyranny of the majority,"" recent events have shown that it can undermine the principle of one person, one vote.

Some argue that the Electoral College system encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign in more states. However, research shows that in recent elections, candidates focus their attention only on swing states that could vote either way. States that lean heavily Democratic or Republican receive relatively little attention. This disadvantages voters in those states. A popular vote would encourage candidates to campaign across the entire country and appeal to more Americans. 

It is also true that the Electoral College system can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. In 2000 and 2016, this exact scenario occurred - the candidate who received the most votes nationally did not become president. This undermines the perception that the winner has a clear mandate from the voters. A president seen as lacking a mandate may face greater difficulty implementing their agenda. Moving to a popular vote would ensure that every vote carries the same weight and that the candidate preferred by the most Americans wins.

Some argue that smaller states would lose influence under a popular vote system. However, candidates would still need to appeal to voters across various regions and demographic groups to win. A straight popular vote does not mean that candidates would focus only on highly populated areas. They would still need to consider the interests of citizens in diverse states. 

In conclusion, while the Electoral College may have made sense historically, it no longer serves its original purpose and can undermine public confidence in elections. A national popular vote is a more democratic system that would encourage higher voter turnout and ensure that every American's voice is equally represented in choosing the president. I encourage you to support a transition to electing the president by popular vote.",0,ed2380a0f5a342d69c4d8788270c2f30
"""The evening star"" venus, is one of the brightest points in the sky. Venus is the second planet away from the sun. Venus can be reffered to as earth's twin because of size and distance from eachother. Earth, Venus, and Mars are the closest to eachother. There can possibly be life on Mars but not really on venus.

Venus' temperature is really really hot which means there is automaticly no possible life on Venus. The text states ""on planet's surface temperatures average 800 degrees faranheit"". This let's me know that there is no possible life Venus. The text also states that ""Venus has the most hottest temperature on surface than any other planet"". That is another reason why,but it states in the text that it is 180 degrees farenheit when you are 30 miles plus away from venus. I don't think we can resist that type of temperature either, but it says that we can but hardly.

The atmospheric pressure of venus is also crazy. The text states that ""the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience"". This let's me know that if try and go into the atmosphere, we would automatically explode. Many erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting happen in Venus as well. Even though mercury is closer to the sun, Venus still has the hottest temperature o surface.

Scientists are still trying to study Venus to see if we can have a chance. You're probably thinking that if the planet is literally unable to live in, why still do visits? Well it states in the passage that ""it once was the most earthlike planet on our solar sytem"". The reason for this is because long ago, Venus was covered in oceans and could have supported various life forms. Scientist are really crazy for that and if they do send out people to study and stuff, they're just letting people die. The reason I say this is because the temperature and atmospheric pressure is insane.

Personally I think that it is not a worthy pursuit to go travel to Venus and perform a few studies. You literally can die while going over there and if the person dies, how are you supposed to know the studies they performed. Honestly I wouldn't do it, but NASA does pay a lot of money, But what's more important, getting the money and have a possible chance of dying or just be safe and sound? Personally I would chose to be safe and sound because one, outer space doesn't really draw my attention. The second one is I would like to be safe and not go through that experience. Now which one would you choose?",1,f822339627534a34b04856e4b1a1afb6
"Successful people are often seen as those who have achieved great things in their lives, whether it is in their career, education, or personal life. While it is true that successful people often have a strong foundation of knowledge and skills, it is also true that they are often willing to try new things and take risks. I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

One of the main reasons why successful people take risks is because they understand that it is the only way to make progress. If they only stick to what they already know how to do, they will not be able to grow and develop new skills. For example, a successful entrepreneur may decide to invest in a new business venture that is outside of their area of expertise. This is a risk, as there is no guarantee of success, but it is also an opportunity to learn and grow.

Another reason why successful people take risks is because they understand that failure is a part of life. They know that even if they fail, they can learn from their mistakes and use the experience to become even more successful in the future. For example, a successful business leader may decide to launch a new product, even though there is no guarantee of success. If the product fails, they can use the experience to make better decisions in the future.

Finally, successful people take risks because they understand that taking risks can lead to great rewards. If they are willing to take a chance, they may be able to achieve something that would have been impossible if they had only stuck to what they already knew. For example, a successful scientist may decide to pursue a new research project, even though there is no guarantee of success. If the project is successful, they may be able to make a breakthrough that could benefit society.

In conclusion, I believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. They understand that taking risks is the only way to make progress, that failure is a part of life, and that taking risks can lead to great rewards.

After five days of this driving ban being in effect the smog in Paris had gone down by 60%. because of this ban the city of Paris is a cleaner place to live now and another result of this ban is that people truly can see how much pollution these cars create.

Another advantage of limiting car use is that once these cars are gone people are much more sociable. In source 1, the government of Germany has created a suburban community where there is no cars. Car ownership is allowed however there are only two places to park and it is very expensive. Because of this 70% of families in this community do not own cars. To get around in this community you are able to walk, ride a bike, skate, etc. As a result, you do not hear cars on the streets but you do hear bike swishing and kids playing with eachother. Many studies have also shown that a day without a car is a very effective stress reliever, as stated in Source 3.

Now a world without cars is very hard to imagine because of all the different places that everybody has to get there however, there are many alternatives to using cars on a daily basis. These alternatives include public transportation, bikes, skates, walking, and also car pooling. If there is a reduction of car usage the environment will receive a very large benefit.

As the articles provided has shown, there are many advantages to the limiting of car usage and it will not only benefit us as humans but also our environment.",1,14a250f9a5db4029a10a8d6c1ed66ddd
"A positive attitude is more helpful to others and motivational,But ones attitude dose not necessarily have to be positive in order to succeed. Ones attitude can be either positive or negative as long as it improves ones ability to succeed. There are many keys to success but attitude is a major key , because attitude introduces or rather shows character. A positive attitude is a great thin but ones attitude can be negative ,but it is more over whelming to others and some might not either like or no longer associate with that person. As long as that attitude helps with your success it should not matter what type of attitude youve got.

Ones attitude is ones guide as it allows more options to come ones way. In a way attitude can guide and help ones path to success or it could close all the doors to ones dreams and success. On the side of a beneficial attitude; people can really catch the feeling of your attitude. What that means is if the attitude is negative but it gets things done then it should not matter as long as it benefits the amount of work or what ever is being or getting done. A positive attitude is more or rather feels more rewarding that much of a negative attitude. A positive attitude is more rewarding and dose allow the people getting that attitude to feel more successful and more appreciated.

Although a positive attitude is more beneficial it can lead into less work or less progess being made and shows that one is not trying hard enough to succeed. By having a negative attitude your showing to others that your work matters. And by doing so you can encourage others or rather inspire others have have a good work ethic by tring your hardeste even if some one is pushing you to work in a negative way. Success come to ones mind and it over comes everything if they put their minds to it.

Yes attitude is a key to success, but it dose not have to be positive if its beneficial to one in their path of success. I do believe that a positive attitude is more appreciated but a negative attitude is less appealing. I feel as long as your attitude is improving your work ethic and it benefits your progress then is should not matter wether or not its positive or negative as long as you have the right mind set you should have a successful work ethic. Your attitude reflect on your work it just depends on how you use your attitude in your work. for example if my boss came in yelling at me saying "" get to work your not getting paid for nothing."" thats a negative attitude so thats going to make me have a negative mind but if i can use that frustration and negativity to inspire e to do my work I will notice that all I have to do is do my work and my bosses attitude will change one me. But if my boss were to have a positive attitude then I could also use that as a motivation as it not only shows me that my boss likes that I do my work but it shows me that im appreciated.

I can see that having a positive attitude is more motivational, but ones attitude can be negative as long as it benefits you and others in a positive way. people need to understand that they can use these attitude to benefit themselves. Peoples attitudes are what helps people succeed as it should motivate and help make their attitude more positive through the day knowing you did good enough to improve your self. Attitude is much more than just success, its the key to motivation.",1,37289d6dfe4f4adf8267344e8daea672

Starting a career at a young age can have both benefits and drawbacks. For instance, individuals who become doctors, lawyers, or teachers at a young age may have more energy and enthusiasm for the job and may be able to become masters of the field earlier in life. On the other hand, they may lack experience and mentorship necessary to succeed and could be overwhelmed by the demands of those professions. 

For example, doctors face long hours and intensive educational requirements, and a young doctor may not be able to handle the responsibilities. In contrast, an experienced doctor may have the practical know-how to handle complex cases with greater ease. Likewise, young lawyers and teachers may struggle to manage the paperwork and classroom environment due to their inexperience.

Overall, starting a career at a young age has its advantages and disadvantages. It is important to weigh the pros and cons in light of particular careers before embarking on a new journey.",0,5bb0b7c35e5a4f9ba9aeef570a2789a2
"The electoral college system has been part of America for many years. At times, this system has proved to be a good thing for our country, but in most times, it has not. I am in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I am in favor of changing to a popular vote because of the unfairness, faulty aspects, and electors in the electoral college.

To begin, the electoral college is fair in some ways, but mostly not. One may understandably say that ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast"" (Posner, 22). The electoral college has proved to be a balance to the political weight of the large states, but regardless of the size of the state, it should be a citizen right to vote directly for their president. ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states"" (Plumer, 13). This quote shows the unfairness to the voters, those in the smaller/more insignificant states don't even matter because of the electoral college! When voting, citizens also become confused with the electors, and potentially vote for their opposing party. Not only is the electoral college unfair for the voters, but for the presidental canidates as well. We as citizens vote for electors whom we must entrust to vote for the party's nominee. This trust is rarely betrayed, but ""...it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral bote will not win the national popular vote"" (Posner, 16). In 2000, the election with Al Gore and George Bush, Gore won the popular vote, but did not win the electoral vote. The people wanted Gore to be the president, but he did not win, due to the unfairness of the ellectoral college.

Another reason I am in favor for the popular vote, is because of the faulty aspects of the electoral college system. A counterargument may be that the electoral college has held our country together, making the voting system a lot easier. But in my opinion this is not true. With popular vote, the citizens would just vote for the president, and whichever canidate recieves the most votes would win. But in the case of the electoral college, states cast only one vote for the entire state! "".. the single representative from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California"" (Plumer, 12). The reason this is such a big deal is because, let's say that 10,000 people voted in Wyoming. 5,001 were republicans, and 4,999 were democrats. The electoral college would pick the elector representing the republican candidate. Thus, Wyoming's vote goes to the republican canidate. Without the ellectoral college though, those 4,999 votes would count, and would go toward helping the desired canidate win. Voting is an individual effort, and the electoral college does not allow for this.

As well as this fault, another fault is the fact that the electors could be anyone. ""They can be anyone not holding public office... Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always"" (Plumer, 10). Although in most cases the electors vote for the correct party, an elector still may not be trustworthy, or loyal. They may even be bias and vote for a different candidate. The electors do not campaign. Only the presidental canidates do. When we vote for the president, we are actually voting for the electors. Voters normally know little, to nothing about the electors. This makes for an even faultier voting experience.

To conclude, electoral colleges are not the way the voting system should be. With popular voting, there will be an assurance that the right candidate will win, the unfair ways of the ellectoral college will be diminished, and there will no longer be any faulty aspects of the voting system. Citizens vote to be heard, and with the electoral college, the people aren't heard as loud as they should be. Voting is a right and priveledge of an American citizien, and popular voting will ensure this right.",1,4a446188e1e04180859c1546ec1c3df9
"To maintain driving and caring for a car takes a lot of money and a lot of time. According to Source 1, Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". Having a means of your own personal transportation does not mean happiness. Yes many teenagers will say that having a car and being able to drive is their freedom but driving is not a necessity and the positives that come from limiting car usage are much greater than having the need for a car.

One negative of driving is greenhouse gases. To simply reduce the amount of greenhosue gases that someone's car tailpipes produce, reduce the amount of driving in that area. Elisabeth Rosenthal, in Source 1, states that ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe""  so if a city were to offer alternative transportation, like public buses or bicycles, that percentage would drastically reduce.

There are certain conditions in which many people purposefully do not go out and drive because it is so dangerous. According to Robert Duffer, in Paris, ""Congestion was down 60 percent..., after five-days of intensifying smog"". If smog can keep people off of the roads and decreases the amount of congestion in that city, imagine what people choosing not to drive could do. That could most likely decrease that amount of congestion even more.

With less people on the road, the roadways would become clearer or less crowded. To ensure that less people would be driving, an alternative transportation system would have to be given. Driving costs lots of money so what do people love more than money? To get things for free. Everyone likes money but no one enjoys spending any. Robert Duffer states, ""Public transit was free of charge form Friday to Monday"". Even though the transportation was free for only four days, four days of not driving your personal car would still greatly decrease the amount of air pollution and money spent out of your pocket.

Another major problem with everyone using their own cars would be the amount of traffic. With fewer cars there would ultimately be fewer traffic. According to Andrew Selsky, in Bogota, Colombia ""...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day, leaving the streets of the capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"". Less traffic jams means that people would reach their destinations quicker. If there were no traffic jams then people would not only reach their destinations quicker but they would reach them extremely quicker. Andrew Selsky later states that hiking, biking, skating, or taking a bus are also all ""good opportunities to take away stress and lower air pollution"".

With less people using cars and roadways to commute, Andrew Selsky writes in Source 3 that ""Parks and sports centers also haved bloomed throught a city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping dristics have cropped up"". As this explains, less cars being used means less money being used and less roadways so there is an abundance of money and space to build new recreational buildings for shopping, eating, playing, and just having fun.

According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in Source 4, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, proposed partnering to ""create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resourced, lower emissions and improve safety'"". This statement from Bill Ford pretty much explains the whole idea of limiting car usage to be one of the best things for this world righ now. So many people commute by car and if just maybe once or twice a week absolutely nobody were to use a car, we would be able to reduce greenhouse gases, conserve our natural resource, save time by no traffic jams, and so many more.",1,e184ed4d0039420e9ee3239aae75f069

Many students choose to graduate early from high school for a variety of reasons, such as wanting to take college courses or begin a career sooner. Before deciding if graduating early is the right choice, it is important for students and parents to consider both the pros and cons. 

One of the key requirements for graduating early is taking additional courses and classes. Doing so can have academic consequences such as missing out on elective courses or having less time to fully explore a particular subject or delve into extra research. Additionally, the extra classes and hours of study could potentially place a strain on a student’s mental health and academic performance.

When weighing the merits of graduating early versus staying in high school for the traditional four years, there are many factors to consider. For some people, the opportunities available with an early graduation may outweigh the potential drawbacks, while for others it may be preferable to stay in school and complete all four years plus any additional classes. 

Ultimately, an informed decision is best. Before making the choice to graduate early, it is important to gather as much information as possible about the requirements, pros, cons, and the academic and mental health consequences that may come with it.",0,e7b644da814b48de962d277424869b42
"Imagine being stuck in traffic again for the fifth time this week. You glance at the time and you see that you're running late for work again. Cars can cause lot of problems like for example, people get into many car crashes that kill many innocent children or bystanders, the traffic jams always take hours to clear up, and the exhaust in the tail pipe is polluting the air. There are many advantages to limiting car usage. The advantages are there will be more people on bikes and walking to place to place, less traffic, and less pollution in the air.

Although cars may come in handy they can be a real pain to have. Like for instance paying car insurance every month, paying for gas, and paying for your car if anything breaks and needs a new part If the car usage was limited there will be more people on bikes and walking. This is good for the residents because they are spending less money and they are getting excersise from this. In Vauban, Germany the residents there have given up their cars. 70% of vaughn's families do not own cars Rosenthal, 3. There only transportation there is a tram that runs though Freiburg Rosenthal, 2. This helps residents there get to place to place easier.

Also with the car limitations there will be a whole lot less traffic on the roads. For example in Paris, France they made even numbered license plates residents leave their cars at home, then the next day odd numbered license plate residents Duffer, 11. Even though they tried to ban the cars there were 40,000 drivers fined due to driving their cars Duffer, 12. Also when this rule was put into place there was less traffic in the capital of France. The traffic went down by 60% Duffer, 14.

Most importantly there will be less pollution in the air. Residents in cars dont really know how much pollution is put into the air when they drive. The exhaust from the tail pipe of a car is causing a huge defect in this earth's greenhouse effect. In france the pollution was so bad there was smog in the air from all the cars Duffer, 14. The smog in France was as bad as the world's most polluted cities in the world, Beijing, China Duffer, 14. Also in Bogota, Colombia there was really bad smog, but after the car limitation there was a huge decrease in the smog Selsky, 21.

In conclusion, there are many advantages in car limitation. The advantages are there will be more people on bikes and walking to place to place, less traffic, and less pollution in the air. With less cars this will help our earth big time because the greenhouse effect will stop getting car exhaust pumped through there. Also we may fine alternate ways to replace gas and oil to make this world healthier.",1,ac346682599d4871a158ef9a07a85828

Adding two more hours to a school's schedule every day could have both positive and negative effects on students. The positive effects include an opportunity to gain extra knowledge in the form of additional classes that could aid in students developing more thoroughly in their areas of interest. Additionally, a longer school day could give students the time to master concepts more thoroughly, leading to increased academic achievement.

On the downside, a longer school day could lead to an increase in student fatigue, as well as introduce problems related to student transportation and fatigue, the latter of which would likely result in students being more likely to become disengaged and uninterested in their studies. Additionally, a longer school day could lead to a decrease in family time, as students would have less hours in the day to do extracurricular activities and spend time with their family. Finally, longer school days could lead to an increase in the amount of stress students feel.",0,ae39b568f7be47b2b828d5d6b5595756
"Cars have been an important part of transportation in society for many years. However, in some communities that is changing. Many young people are not getting their licenses and some are giving up their cars. The streets of Vauban, Germany, are mainly ""carfree"" and the suburb only has two places to park cars, at the expense of 40,000. Limiting car usage results in many advantages.

One of those advantages is helping the environment. The article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer explains Paris, France, put a driving ban into effect because of smog rivaling that of Beijing, China. The ban was based on license plate number, only allowing certain numbers to drive on specific days. Eventually the ban was lifted because the smog had cleared enough. Limiting the number of people that used their cars resulted in cleaner air, which is healthier for everyone. If limits were put into effect into other places, that could reduce air pollution, helping the environment. Americans are also buying fewer cars and driving less than previous years. The article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal says, ""If the pattern persists and many sociologists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"". That is another example of environmental benefits from limiting car use. By utilizing other forms of transportation, the impact a person has on the environment is greatly reduced.

Another advantage that comes from limiting car use is lower stress and better mental health. In the suburb of Vauban, Germany, fiftyseven percent of families sold their cars to move there and seventy percent do not own cars. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Heidrun Walter says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". By not owning a car, a person has less stress and can relax when traveling. There is probably less focus needed when traveling without a car because there is no worry about other drivers. Bogota, Colombia has started the Day Without Cars, the goal being to promote alternate transportation. Violaters recieve fines of twentyfive dollars. In the article ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, Carlos Arturo Plaza says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". People could enjoy the outdoors, without the constant noise and pollution from traffic in the city. That could lower their stress and increase their happiness.

Limiting car use has many advantages, some of which are helping the environment and lowering stress. Some suburbs, specifically Vauban, Germany, are mostly ""carfree"". A trend of buying fewer cars and driving less is also growing in America, which is beneficial to the environment. Plus, the stress of driving a car is taken away when their use is limited.",1,998a402ba01d44909f2ad90bd7db9023
"Around the world, citites are getting improved by reducing the usage of cars. With the new ways of transportation such as bike, foot, car-pool and public transportation (bus, train, taxi) there has been many great out comes. Many people should join in on this limiting of car usage. It saves time, conserves resources, lowers emmisions and improves safety. Many citites, such as Vauban, Paris and Bogota have taken steps to creating a car free community.

In Vauban, Germany many residents of this community dont even own a car. The people are allowed to own a car but they have two options of parking that result in buying a space or a home with a space. With this great cost of spaces, up to 70 percent of the families do not own a car. Many people living this life style are very happy with not owning a car. Heidrun Walter thought that ""when [she] had a car [she] was always tense. [And she] is much happier this way"". It was proven that 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe is from passenger cars. The idea of a ""car reduced"" community is very appealing to many people and is starting to spread to many locations.

The ban of driving has also spread to Paris. Paris started off by banning any motorists with an even-numbered license plate, and the following day the same would apply to the odd-numbered plates. There was a descrease of congestion by 60 percent. France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline, which lead to the blame of diesel for the intensifying smog in the city. Around 67 percent of the vehicles in France are diesel  compared to the 53 percent average of diesel engines in the first of Western Europe. With just the few short carless days, the smog cleared from the city and the ban was rescined a day after.

There are also traditions such as ""Car-free day"" in Bogota, Colombia. On this day, car owners leave their cars at home and turn to hiking, biking, skating or bus taking. The main goal for this day is to promote alternative transportation and reduce the smog. Many people join in, resulting in a very large turn out, saying that ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". It is thought that the people participating in this event are ""generating a revolutionary change"" . Not only has this day helped to decrease the pollution and smog in the city, it has brought improvements to the city. There has been a restriction on rush-hour which leads to the cut in traffic, sidewalks are being replaced, parks and sports centers are blooming throughtout the city and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

These different ways of limiting car usage have also spread to the United States. President Obama has large goals to ""curn the United States' greenhouse gas emmisions"". Recent studies have shown that Americans are buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses as the years go by. There has also been a reduced amount of car ownership per household. Many sociologists believe it will have ""beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" with transportation being the second largest source of the United States emissions. In a span of nine years, a study found that driving by young people had decreased 23 perecent. Discussions at the Mobile World Congress lead to a plan for a world where personal vehicle ownership it impractical or undesirable.

Many citites in the world are starting to see the damage cars can do to the environment and also how wonderful and stress-free life can be withouth them. Many new ides are being started to reduce the car usage everywhere. Most people agree with these ideas, most even find them beneficial. There are many advantages of limiting car usage and it seems many people have found these advantages which has resulted to the decrease of car culture everywhere.",1,99bed0f6332e48fdafd283dd78e551ad
"Cars are used everyday to get from one place to another. In some places, people depend on cars more than others that live in different parts of the world. However, the reduction of car usage has many advantages the planet would greatly benefit from less pollution, traffic jams would not be as frequent, and people become more healthy as a result.

Limiting the use of cars would greatly help the problem of pollution in the world today. In the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars, she describes what affects cars have on pollution, ""Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middleclass families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe....Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United states"" Rosenthal. One can clearly see that cars are a major factor in the pollution dilemma that so many people are trying to resolve. Everyone can take a part in the resolution of reducing pollution by depending less on cars and using other modes of transport such as public transportation, biking, or even walking. Some cities are placing enforcements to ban the usage of cars. Paris is an example of one of these locations. The result of the enforcement was that congestion or smog went down 60 percent. This is a great improvement for the city, which is known for having nearrecord pollution. Multiplying these enforcements to other cities would definitely bring down a large percent of the pollution found on Earth. This is benefiting not only the planet, but also the population that lives on the planet by enabling them to breathe healthier air.

The cause of traffic jams is the abundant amount of cars on the road, which could be avoided if less cars were used. Andrew Selsky wrote in his article, Carefree Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota , ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carefree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" Selsky. With no cars to clog the streets, a relaxed sentiment took the place of a usually anxious and hurried feeling. Rushhour restrictions were put in act, and have drastically cut traffic. Less honking takes place, and more time is saved in order to get to one's destination. Cars are not always needed to get someone where they want to go, and the enviornment is less stressul without all of the congestion of cars on the road.

People become more healthy when car usage is limited. Instead of taking a car to get from point A to point B, some people are walking or biking instead. This is a huge benefit to the people that are exercising. Also, in Carefree Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota, it says that parks and sports centers have bloomed throuhout the city of Bogota because of the decreased usage of automobiles. The parks and sport centers help people stay active and healthy.

Although cars are useful in order to get to one's destination, there are many advantages to cutting back the usage of them. A huge advantage is that pollution would drastically go down. Another is the time and stress saved from less traffic jams. Lastly, people would benefit from the way they are making their lives more healthy.",1,64c541895cad43a6b70be444f6c9c029

"Cars make it exceptionally easy to travel and move around. Auto use permits an individual to go to places they have not been before. In Europe, the countries that share the shingen space allow Europeans to move freely. To avoid pricy plane and train tickets, a lot of Europeans use their cars to go to an entirely different country and experience a variety of different cultures in a matter of hours. It is most certainly a privilege. Despite the many pros of having a car, the cons outweight them. Throughout this essay I will explain the advantages of limiting car usage.

In many countries and cities car usage has dropped. Some countries,it is purely accidental or due to economic reasons and in some cities and countries, this decline is intended. In a city called Vauban in Germany, citizens have given up their cars. In this city,street parking,driveways and garages are more often than not forbidden. This may seem strange to not have the privilege to own a car or a garage. But most of the residents have moved out from the city to live here. Heidrun Walter claims that she is much happier this way and before she was always tense.70% of the vaughn's family do not own a car, and 57% sold their cars to live in Vauban. This particular city is a mere example of a growing trend in Europe,the United States and various other country. The plan is to separate suburban life from auto usethis movement is called ""smart planning"".

In opposition, to these efforts, automobiles are usually an important factor to the suburbs where usually middleclass people live. This causes a huge impediment to current efforts to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from passenger cars. In Europe,passenger cars are the reason for the 12 percent of greenhousee gas emissions in the United states that number almost quadruples in size in some carintensive areas. The approach is to make suburbs more compact rather than having malls on the border on distant highways.

Due to smog and pollution to this global city's air, Paris enforced a driving ban to put an end to polution. 4,000 drivers were rightfully so fined that day. This issue had to be taken seriously for a greater cause. For example, for the smog levels to decrease and to purify the air in the cities and suburbs and to prevent pollution. Public transit was free for those five days that the ban was enforced. Congestion dropped 60% in Paris, ever since the driving ban. The smog rivaled Beijing, which is often known for being one of the most polluted cities in the world. Diesel fuel was blamed because of a tax policy in favor of diesel fuel in France. More than half of vehicles run on diesel fuel in France.

In the Colombia's capital, Bogota, many colombians hiked,skated or took buses to work in spirit of their car free day. Personally I think this was an extravagent idea. It teaches people to not be so dependent on cars. This day significantly reduced traffic jams,smog and promoted transportation. This was a wonderful oppurtunity to lower stress and air pollution at the same time! Parks and sports bloomed that day, sidewalks that were unfinished and in poor conditions were replaced,the traffic decreased and restaurants blossemed. This car free day had an amazing impact on this community and the world.

Due to recents studies, Americans are driving less and buying few cars as the years go by. The miles driven have peaked in 2005 , but as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person dropped 9% , and was equal to the percentage in Janurary 1995. Scientist state that this decline is beneficial for carbon emissions and the enviroment. Although this might affect dearly the car industries. The rise of cellphones,internet and apps this permits a more flexible way of making commuting arangements,and the evolution of vans services.

A lot of people have been using public transportation and biking to get around. There has been a drop from 1639 year olds in getting their license. Getting license is not as big as of priority for those people. They revolve their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take busses and trains or carpool with friends.

To conclude, I strongly believe that limiting car use would benefit different aspects in peoples lives. But for people to give up using cars,the recontruction of suburban cities is a very important. I live in the suburbs and despite the houses around, you would need a car to go to the grocery store,restaurant and to have fun with your friends. Highways usually circle around suburban cities and that may cause congestion. To make car usage less of a priority for citizens, we would have to think of the greater cause and to restablish cities to not prohibit people from moving around. The decline in car use will improve the world for the generations to come.",1,8b003d29b2f84ba0940bbbd17a815c67
"Many cities and countries are starting a new trend that is not using cars at all. Vehicles can cause many problems such as air pollution, congested roads, and injuries due to wrecks. Some cities have started some type of way to promote how bad vehicles really are and advising people on what to do to stop driving.

For three years in Bogota, Colubia, the city has a day called, ""Day Without Cars"" where in this city, home of seven million citizens, nobody can use a vehicle unless they are willing to pay a $25 fee if they were get caught. Columbians greatly support this cause by hiking, biking, skating, and taking the bus to work. This caused the roads to be clear and not congested like they usually are.

Paris has a system to help support limiting car use as well. They take even and odd numbered license plates and designate a day that's either even or odd. On the even day, car owners that have an even license plate are ordered to leave their car at home, and vice versa for odd. If they have drive their car on the day they were ordered to leave it home, they have to pay a fee of $31.

The United States has reached a point to where cars are starting to become unpopular. In 2005, the amount of miles driven peaked, and in April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was down approximately 9% below the peak in 2005. That is eqaul to where the U.S. was in 1995.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that some companies that are in the computer/cell phone business are making more money. In the United States, many people are using the computer and telephone to communicate with people because it's faster and easier to access than having to drive around town to meet with someone. This means that computer websites are making more money and the phone companies are making more money since people are using their phones more often.

Next, cars can cause major stress to some people. Traffic jams, animals running across the road, not being able to see due to smog, and car accidents stress people out because they are either too busy to deal with it or being scared that they might hurt someone/something or may even get hurt themselves. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter in an article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal.

Also people's health could improve tremendously as a result of limiting car usage. Walking to work could burn the calories that people ate at breakfast. Hiking, running, skating, and biking to meet up for lunch or for little kids to go to the play ground could greatly increase people's health. Since people would be technically exercising while going to places, they would be more proned to drinking water to rehydrate themselves which would make them a healthier person in the process as well.

The process of limiting car usage has started or has already taken over cities and countries. It can reduce stress, increase the health of people, and increase the profit for business. The advantages of limiting car usage may seem small, but in the end they will have a huge impact on societies.",1,ae937e45c81445a8acc1fc912fbc5a75
"DOES ELECTORAL COLLEGE WORK?

I think is the electoral college is important  that is established it in the constitution in the country . the security in the person. for good electoral gollege have much progress congressional , election and vote .no easy. the diferent  person think the ideas diference through. they think easy the working realize and think delit and no just election and vote for person is going tramp and the diferent person think is no just that president have more the time stablished is incorrect other person necesity have oportunities in be elector.

The electoral college is popular for used.''Abolishing the electoral college! They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after al gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency , over 60  porcent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. the dirent argument in united states '' the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor'' te united staste have diferent forms the using electoral college sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidares themselves.''the senate would choose the vice-president. the diferent senator's popular did diferences electoral college in parts of the united states. example : ''Nixon, Jimmy carter, bob Dole, the U.S camber of commerce, and the AFL-Cio all.''

One example ''republicans in california. knowing their vote will have no effect , they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaigh than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.... but of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did nvote in (2012)election''.

"There are many advantages of limiting car usage. It affects your mental health. It effects your environment. It effects people and companies economically, too. These articles provide a lot of information, and I'm going to use examples from the text to show you.

First, limiting car usage affects peoples mental health. Most people say it makes them happier using different modes of transportation.

""""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two,..."" This is an example from the 1st article, in German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" written by Elizabeth Rosenthal.

""""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife."" Here's another example, from carfree day is spinning into a big hit in bogota written by Andrew Selsky. Although some people are mad having to use a bus or a train with other people, it's a good stress reliever not having to drive all the time and not having to deal with the road rage.

Second, limiting car usage effects the environment. Cars give off gas that's not good for the Earth. The gas from the cars creates smog in some parts of the world.

""Paris typically has more smog than any other European capitals..."" In that quote from paris bans driving due to smog written by Robert Duffer, it shows that the smog is having an affect of them. Safety is also something that would be increased if we limited car usage.

""""Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."""" With less cars around, people would be less likely to get hit. Right now, many people die every day from a car accident or a hit and run. If we lessen the amount of cars on the road, we'd also improve road rage and traffic flow.

Finally, limiting the amount of car usage would effect people and companies economically. People wouldn't have to pay for gas as much as they would have to. It would help out public transportation companies, like the company that runs the Lynx busses or the Line' in Chicago. It would cause a decline in autoinsurance companies and car companies that sell the cars.

""...companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle."" This quote from the article 'The End of Car Culture' by Elisabeth Rosenthal, shows that car companies are trying to stay ahead of their competition. They're trying to appeal to people who prefer bikes or buses rather than a personal vehicle.

""...recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" In this quote from the same passege, it shows that we're already nearing this goal. Car usage is already being limited by the newer generations of people who care about the planet and find it easier to bike or use public transportation.

In conclusion, limiting the usage of cars would help a lot. I think that helping the environment would really be good for us as people. Limiting the usage of cars would make it safer to walk around and bike outside, even drive. It helps people economically even though it hurts certain companies economically. It also helps us mentally by helping us be less stressful and calming down more easily. It would reduce road race as well as certain stress alltogether.",1,468ccc96dbed4860b3e90d016bf2891a
"The Electoral College is a process by which we vote for electors not actually the president themself. When you vote for the electors, they decide who will be the president. We, as voters, have a right to be able to vote for whomever we choose not someone to choose for us. We should change the Electoral College to election by popular vote because it gives the people a say in who runs our country, an easier way to elect persons into office, and no one state has more of a say.

Many poeple believe that we are voting for the president when we vote for our electors, but in reality, we are voting for them to vote. We, as the people of the United States of America, have always had the right to freedom freedom of speech, religion, ect. so why don't we have the freedom to directly choose our president? In the source, the Indefensible Electoral college: Why even the bestlaid defences of the system are wrong', it states ""...voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This means that we do not vote directly, only for someone else to decide our fate. Written in the text fo the first source, 'What Is the Electoral College?', it reads ""...when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" With this method, we are never getting results directly, only becoming the middleman when we should be front and center.

Most think that if we have electors we won't have as much trouble getting a person in office. In the eleventh paragraph, in source 2: The Indefensible Electoral college: Why even the bestlaid defences of the system are wrong', under what's wrong with the electoral college', its speaks of a ""disaster factor"". The ""disaster factor"" is when we vote for electors and they defy the will of the people as this had almost happened with segregationists, nearly making the popular vote for Kennedy not go to Kennedy. As well as the fact that we could easily of had a tie in the electoral vote. As it says in the second source, the matter would fall into the hands of the House of Representatives ""...the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president."" This means each state has one vote, meaning the will of the people wouldn't have much say in the election.

People in a state all have the same electors, made by a popular vote, practically taking away the people's voice. If things were to change to popular vote we would all have a say in each election. In the Electoral College way of voting, it is ""...unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakesall system in each state."" Along with the fact that in the Electoral College way, the amount of electors is based on population, making the people of a small state insignificant. ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all..."" If all small states stay this way, they may never be able to have a say in any big decision made by the public.

In conclusion, we, as the people of the United States of America, need to inderstand that the road we are headed down with the Electoral College, is not a good road. We need to stand up and allow everyone to be able to have a say in elections. With the popular vote every citizen will have they're own say in what gets made of our beautiful country. We, the people, need to make the change from Electoral College voting to popular vote becauseit gives people a say in who runs our country, an eaier way to elect someone into office, and no one state has more of a say than another.",1,cd4c56d18b7a4d7a821635f417ae00bc
"There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that supports the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do. For example, a study by the University of Michigan found that people in their twenties reported the highest levels of happiness and satisfaction with life. Another study by the University of Utah found that people in their twenties were more likely to report having a great time in their life than people in their thirties or forties.

There are a number of reasons why young people seem to enjoy life more than older people. For one, young people are still exploring and learning about the world. They are also more likely to be optimistic and have a positive outlook on life. As they continue to grow and learn, they may start to see the world in a different way than their parents or grandparents do. This may lead to them having more fun and enjoying life more.

There are also a number of practical reasons why young people may enjoy life more than older people. For example, young people are generally more active and have more energy than older people. This may lead to them having more fun and being more active in their free time. Additionally, young people are often more entrepreneurial and are looking for new opportunities and challenges. This may lead to them enjoying life more because they are constantly moving and experiencing new things.

"Seeking multiple choice help me see if it's a good choice or not that I pick what i pick. So say if I went to the store with my mom, dad, and sister and I seen a orange but then I seen a apple. So what I would do is ask my mom which one should I get and then ask my dad finally i would ask my sister and if two of them say i should get the oranges and one of them say apples then i'm going to get the apple. I like asking people what items I should get because it help me make up my mind.

Sometimes If i ask people something it's really hard for me to make up my mind what i should pick. Usually i just close my eyes and spin around and which ever one I'm pointing at is the one i'm getting. But that was when i was a young kid now i just ask my family which one i should get it usually helps me a lot. But you can't just walk up to someone and be like which one should I get i mean some people are okay to say that to but I wouldn't do it because it is dergurous. If i was you Just stick with asking the people that you know like family or friends.

Another example say if i wanted to go hunting with my dad because he loves to hunt but i want to go fish with my grandpa because he loves fishing. So first i would have to go ask my mom and see what she say most likely she going to say my dad so then i ask my sister what should i do and she loves both of them but she would say ""my grandpa because he older man and i always go hunting"". so know to make it far i would probably go on social media and ask my friends and if most of them agree that i should go with my grandpa i take the one vote and add that to my other friends. Then if they say my dad i do the same thing I did with my grandpa add up all the vote from my friends and then add one on to it from my mom. and then i got my answer if i should go with my dad or grandpa.

If you have one choice it not as good as two choices. You maybe don't like that one choice and it would never hurt to ask more then one person. Also some people might give a good reason why you should do what you are doing and if you have go reason for both you just can't go with one you have to go with multiple choice. It's always good to go with more then one answer because you never know how much fun you have if you don't .You never know go big or go home.

When asking for advice it's can be hard at times that why you ask for many answer as you can get. Talking to people can be fun to you never know until you try it. I'm pretty sure it help a lot of people make choice on what they have to do. For example my grandma had cancer she had a choice of living and having to get surgery and have a hard time or we had a choice just letting her past away we didn't want her to have hard times so we made a vote Then we knew it was going to be hard but it was okay so we let her go. seeking multiple choices help in life it help with anything and everything.",1,97feeaaaf9b04e4e95764ece775851be
"Dear state senator,

The Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote. I say this because, as successful as the Electoral College has been, it has many flaws. In the first sentence of the eleventh paragraph, the article mentions something called the disaster factor. This is an alarming possiblity. State legislatures are, in a way, responsible for choosing electors who may ignore the will of the people.

During 1960, in the Louisiana legislature, people titled Segregationists almost succeeded in removing the Democratic electors and replacing them with new electors. These new electors were supposed to oppose John F. Kennedy so that any popular votes for Kennedy would not have really gone to him. If those Segregationists had succeeded in their plan, John F. Kennedy would not have won the popular vote. That was indeed a close call, and it could happen yet again in the near future without fail. On another similar topic, ""faithless"" electors have, from time to time, denied the option to vote for their party's candidate. Instead of voting for the candidate of their own party, they cast a vote for whomever they wish.

Also occuring in 1960, a state sent two slates of electors to Congress. Vice President Richard Nixon validated only his opponent's electors. Thankfully, he was presiding over the Senate at the time. He made sure to validate the slate of his choosing ""without establishing a precedent."", as stated in paragraph eleven, sentence 9. Hopefully, this will not occur again anytime soon.

The most worrying occurance would be a tie. However, if a tie were to happen in an electoral vote, the election would be thrown towards the House of Representatives. There, the state delegations vote on the president. In 1976, a tie would have happened if 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 voters from Hawaii had voted the other way. This is bad because the election is only a few voters away from a distaster. In conclusion, the Electoral College is not only unfair, but outdated and irrational. It should be shifted from the way it is now to total amount of popular votes for the president of the United States.",1,9314d2ff67514b93b712c7e4c9dce604
"The mind can perform differently when extensively staring into a phone screen and causes a lot of distractions in the classroom setting depending on how it's used. As for educational purposes, using a cellphone to probably schedule some test dates, or save notes for later use can really improve keeping track of class subjects and assignments, considering most individuals carry their cellular devices on them every time of the day. We also have notifications on our devices to notify us on when we've missed an important assignment or other things.

The real issue is whether the students are actually taking advantage of it's dependability to actually improve their classroom performance. The human brain can be effected on how long you use the phone regardless of where you are, and that issue goes across all devices. When having used your phone maybe in the middle of the night before a major test, your sleep is cut by maybe an hour due to the eyes being exposed to blue light shifts, which is the brightness of the phone seeping into your eyes, so it is very critical on how the person uses the device before, during, and after school.

Now another big issue is having the freedom and functionality to use the phone however you'd like. This is where a teenager's habit of text, calling, or sending pictures, brings up the debate of using cellphones for educational purposes. It is very easy to get distracted by other uses of the phone while also very easy to take answers from maybe a friend or find cheat sheets online. We don't have the right to control how people use their phone and that's where my opinion on it leans towards restriction policies and or, giving full responsibility to the teacher about when they can use their phone.

Our phones are also effectively useful for keeping a calendar and keeping us notified of the important things in life especially in the educational sense where paper and memory just don't suit us very well anymore in this day and age. Phone's are evolving rapidly and manufacturers are finding new ways of making them more useful for work, school, and social media. Modern education now requires plenty of technology to keep us updated, and there will eventually be a day where education is fully integrated into computers and touch screen devices.

I do agree we need some form of policy or agenda to make use of the phone to help our student's with how they're approaching their education. Teachers must have to conduct the convenience of the phone and whether a certain student can use it properly and educationally. It is a unique creation we have come to experience in our time, and I hope our generation can think heavily on this matter with a progressive and open mind. All it takes is serious debate and rationality for both sides of a subject matter to be comfortable and conclude with what helps us most while also advancing our students properly.",1,21a6e5e04e1f4be7b06bac4d706064d8
"Deaor Mor. Senatoor, What is the Electooral College? Can voteors contorol whom theior electoors vote foor? Not always. The Electooral College is an unfaior, outdated, and iororational porocess. Although many believe it is a necessity foor choosing a poresident, it is not. I believe the porocess of choosing a poresident should be changed to the election by populaor vote in the United States.

Fiorst, what is the Electooral College? In the passage ""What Is the Electooral College"" it says, ""It is a porocess by which the founding fatheors established in the Constitution as a comporomise between election of the Poresident by a vote in Congoress and election of the Poresident by a populaor vote of qualified citizens. The poresidential election is held eveory fouor yeaors on the Tuesday afteor the fiorst Monday in Novembeor. You help choose youor state's electoors when you vote foor youor Poresident because when you vote foor youor candidate you aore actually voting foor youor candidates electoors."" But, little did the fouding fatheors know it is not oreally a comporomise. The Electooral College is composed of 538 electoors.Some of them unfaior ones too. A majoority of 270 electooral votes is orequiored to elect the Poresident. In souorce 2 it says, ""The poresidential election is held eveory fouor yeaors on the Tuesday afteor the fiorst Monday in Novembeor. You help choose youor state's electoors when you vote foor youor Poresident because when you vote foor you or candidate you aore actually voting foor youor candidates electoors."" Second, the Electooral College is not a place, it is a porocess, an unfaior, outdated, and iororational porocess. Accoording to the passage ""The Indefensible Electooral College"" it states how, ""Undeor the Electooral College system, voteors vote not foor the poresident, but foor a slate of electoors who in tuorn elect the poresident."" Do you think that is faior? This porocess is confusing and it should be abolished. Due to the Electooral College many people get confused and sometimes vote foor the worong candidate. In the souorce ""The Indefensible Electooral College"" it says, "" faithless electoors have occasionally orefused to vote foor theior paorty's candidate and cast a deciding vote foor whomeveor they please."" That is unfaior, and iororational. People should be able to have a choice, although they let you feel like you'ore doing something by voting, you actually aore not doing much. The Electooral College gets the last woord.

Thiord, some aorgue that the Electooral College has good intentions, they suppoort theior claims with ideas stated in the passage ""In Defense of the Electooral College"" some such as ""The Electooral College orestoores some of the weight in the political balance to laorge states, the Electooral College orequiores a poresidential candidate to have toransoregional appeal, oor the Electooral College avoids the poroblem of elections in which no candidate orecieves a majoority of the votes cast."" Although these oreasons may be valid, they'ore not enough to puorsuade thousands of U.S citizens that the Electooral College should not be abolished.

Cat got youor tongue? In conclusion, as you can see the Electooral College is not always the best way to choose a poresident, it is unfaior, it is outdated since the founding fatheors had set it up, and it is iororational. the Electooral College should be oreplaced with the porocess of populaor vote.",1,fc7354c80e114a57b87f7ba9c16ac551
"The Challenges of Parenting a Special Needs Child. Raising children is difficult enough, but raising a special needs child presents unique challenges and obstacles. It’s not easy to watch your child struggle with physical or developmental disabilities, yet the rewards can be great if you persevere. Parents of special needs children must acquire specialized knowledge and skills in order to advocate for their child and help them reach their fullest potential. Firstly, parents need to build a support network to provide help through the toughest times. This includes both family members who can offer emotional support as well as professionals such as doctors and therapists who specialize in treating conditions related to special needs children. Gaining access to these services requires patience, research, advocacy skills, and plenty of time spent on paperwork—but it’s worth it when done correctly! Building relationships with teachers at school will also be important so that they understand how best to educate your child according to his/her individual learning style or ability level. . Next, understanding what medical care is necessary for the particular condition is key; ensuring that medications are taken properly each day if required along with staying up-to-date on doctor appointments are top priorities for any parent caring for a special needs child. The planning involved should include patterns of daily habits like sleeping/eating schedules which often require modifications due to the extra energy needed by some children affected by disabilities; knowing when an activity has gone too far before becoming detrimental is essential in maintaining balance between playtime fun and proper rest periods. In addition, there may be certain treatments or therapies (such as occupational therapy) recommended—parents should stick closely with following all advice from experienced health practitioners whenever possible in order for their own peace-of-mind as well as optimal outcomes regarding quality life experiences available specifically tailored towards their little one's own personal needs based upon diagnosis specifics given over time from said experts within respective fields accordingly moving forward into future growth stages being monitored continuously ‘With Love &

"Is the cost to potentially end a life in a matter of seconds and cause collision in exchange to glance at your mobile smartphone worth the risk. Is it really worth causing harm to yourself and others to check if your smartphone received a notification. Do not risk the lives and safety of other people on the road because you're preoccupied with irrelevant phone use.

Issues such as accidents , deaths, tickets, etc can be avoided if the owner of the mobile device does not allow distraction by the device overcome them. Most drivers who usually drive while using their phone take matters such as the effects very lightly and not serious enough. They do not understand the consequences and the permanent changes when it comes to the controversy. Many drivers claim that there are no bad results or claim that all the fuss is unnecessary and exaggerated. What they do not comprehend is in a matter of seconds everything could be a blur and possibly be the end. When driving, the driver should take much precaution and take driving on the road very serious and not as a joking manner. Before even compulsing to use the mobile phone , think about who you as a driver could put in danger while on the road and think clearly while reflecting the consequences.

There are many forms to be away from the mobile device until the driver arrives at the destination to use the device once again. The driver must find strategies to help the bad habit end or find a way to resist the desire to obtain the device. Instead of having the compulsion to utilize the smartphone the driver can do many things to avoid causing accidents. For Example, if the driver has no need or hurry to arrive at the destination , what can be done is they can pull over on the side of the road or find a destination to park and have the liberty to use the cellular device.

Another useful strategy , could be to purchase a device that is Hands-Free Bluetooth Headset, which is a very effective technological device. By purchasing the device, it will reduce the constant movement to grab for the cellphone and revise it. The sole purpose of the device is to avoid the driver to grab the smartphone when there is an incoming phone call and occupy the device to make answering simpler. Also, causes no movement, only requires the driver to press a button and answer any incoming call without physically holding the phone, the device is only restricted to answer calls and listen to music.

There are certain states within the United states that yield the issue of obtaining a cellphone while driving. With having that issue and referring to fatal or minor accidents or issues relating to using cellphone causes the government to pass laws to better improve the issue. The cause to pass and enact the law over banning cellphone use while conducting a vehicle is from reports of fatal deaths, bodily injuries and many accidents have increased. There are some states that take note that majority of crashes or any incident involves the cellphone use. Despite efforts to control the use of cellphone calmly does not give any effect which leads to the enactment of the law. When using the cellular device comes a consequence to pay such as receiving tickets, fines and penalties will come along with not obeying the law. There will no longer be any tolerance of the mobile device use , if you are found at guilt , if the state you live in has passed a law over the driving no phone use.

One thing drivers will ignore and be naive to is the constant use of operating a vehicle with a cellphone in possession. It's unacceptable to be cause of a collision or even worse cause death to innocent driver due to the driver wanting to be on social media, talk on the phone,etc.

A driver can discover many useful methods to reduce the cellular use, such as using a Bluetooth Headset to answering or simply parking on the side of the road to attend the cellphone. Before causing harm put others people lives before the irrelevant technology that can be used later on. Take precaution, be aware of consequences and be reasonable if using the mobile device while driving which should only be used if there is an emergency or utilizing a Wireless device to answer phone calls.",1,6282935c98a64203baf499871a550314
"First, I like the way the author write the introduction, because in the article on paragraph 1"" sometimes called the evening star and Venus is the secont planet form our sun"" shows the author really knows what he/she is talking about. He also support it by including Earth, Venus ,and Mars are goes by different speed; Venus is sometimes right around the conner but sometimes we far from it and closer Mars.

Second, I can tell that the authors research about the past ,because in the article in paragraph 2"" each previous mission was unmanned, no spacecarft survived, and not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades"" shows he actually know about spacecraft and about 3 decades ago. Also, in paragraph 7 he also conclude about first envisioned in 1800s and 1940s during World War ll.

Third, I like the way the author use to describe Venus because in paragraph 2 and 3, he/she describe by saying"" Often referred to as Earth twin"" and in paragrath 4 the author suupport it by saying"" it may well once have been the most Earth like planet"" and "" probably covered largely with oceans and various forms of life"".

Finally, in the author included about how NASA will be keep challenging to get to the Venus safely and how they will going to working on a machines that last long enought to contribute meaningfully knowledge of venus. This shows that the author researched about how NASA Challenging to get to Venus. To support my sentence, In paragraph 7 "" eletronics made of silicon carbide have lasted for three weeks"".

In conclusion, the author is good at introduction and the explaining details ,because I can actually imagine how the Venus will be look like just by reading this article.",1,3bcfc3292f5f4f67a428a349829663ba
"Dear Senator of Florida,

Electoral Colleges are big parts in the presidential elections, but I don't think we should use them anymore, I think we should elect our president by popular vote.

Why should Electoral Colleges not be used anymore? They should'nt be used anymore because as it states in paragraph 10, source 2 that "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Meaning that who you vote for goes through the system and then if all the electors felt like you did the electors would give the votes towards that candidate. But if they didnt feel the same way as the majority of the voters than maybe another candidate would end up with more electoral votes.

Another example is the 2000 elections, Al Gore recieved more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, recieving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266, it says in source number 2. If the majority of people vote for one person, why does another become President? It doesnt seem fair to me, if the people vote for what they want they should get what they asked for.

In the diagram in source 3, it shows the amount of votes each state gets if you look at the difference in the numbers you can see why this is not fair. For example Rhode Island has only 1 vote but California has 55, if the whole state of Rhode Island votes for the same candidate and only 51% of California votes for a Candidate, who do you think the upper hand willgo for? Oh yeah! California's vote. And that goes for a lot of states, half of the country can vote for the same president but they have a small amount of votes and California has 55! Its not fair at all.

So to finish this argument I ask for a change, I think when electing our President it should be by PO",1,790ceb9312e2426d85c240e3e88e00b4
"In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the use of Facial Action Coding System technology to read the emotions of students ina classroom is valuable.

This is shown through the author's description of the benefits of being able to read expressions of students, as well as the increased understanding of emotions that can be uncovered due to this technology.

Recently, Prof. Thomas Huang and his colleague have developed ways for computers to better communicate with humans through a program designed to calculate noverbal human emotions.

This technology has proved able to recognize expressions of humans, and so has expanded the frontiers of human communication with technology.

In particular, this advancement could provide benefits in the education system.

The reading of expressions in studnets would prove beneficial to the educational process of understanding what content best suits a student's learning ability.

Dr. Huang predicts, ""A class Room computer could recognize when a studnet is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto 6).

This shows how the technology would allow a computer to effectively ""recognize"" a students emotions, and correlate or ""modify"" the corresponding lesson to better fit his or her learning.

It would provide an ""effective"" tool for intructors to be able to better understand what their student needs in order to succeed.

Expressions or feelings such as ""confusion"" or being ""bored"" would allow teachers to better invest time and effort in teaching topics that best fit with these emotions, and so it would help make teaching easier in response to the needs of students.

The technology would also continue to increase knowledge of human emotions through interpretation of the many expressions such as nonverbal communication.

In turn this would help with the education of students, as an increased understanding of human feelings would allow the system to acknowledge issues or needs that specific students have.

Being able to match their emotional abilities with the best subject for them to succeed in would be an option.

This would provide teachers with a system that best maximizes potential and limits issues in the classroom that involve expression or emotion.

D'Alto writes, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness - and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" (D'Alto 3).

From this we can see that if implemented, this technology could help identify primary human emotions such as ""happiness"" or ""anger"".

This would allow computers to identify ""characteristic movements"" and translate this into emotion.

With this technology at our disposal, we can better understand how people in general portray their feelings through the anatomy of their face, and better understand the identity of these emotions in the physical aspects of expression.

This understanding would in turn allow students and teachers to better understand their emotions, and so best match their tendencies to educational programs or classes.

Continuing with the idea of better understanding emotions in the technology would also prevent issues relating to student behavior such as academic honesty or problems with stress or anger, as understanding the emotional expression conveyed by students would help implement systems to better prevent these unwanted actions.

For instance, the author writes, ""But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle... To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful"" (D'Alto 8).

This is an example of the increased benefits of this technology, and particularly pertaining to education, it can be used to detect whether students are being honest or ""truthful"" through their expressions.

Although it is not guaranteed, the technology would still provide another option in understanding what studnets feel or what they are truly going through.

It would allow schools or instructors to change their teaching or development programs in order to relieve studnets of unwanted emotion, and it would also help benefit the disciplinary system, as being able to detect true emotions could help distinguish one issue from another.

Overall and in conclusion, a better understanding of human expression by technology provides an improved tool for instructors to help with the learning and development of students, as this allows them to fit learners' studying emotional tendencies with that of the best option or way of teaching.",1,24215021220045a68cd75dcb4360992b
"Venus is a planet in our solar system, which is sometimes visible in the Earth's night sky. Scientists are considering ways to get humans to Venus, and in order to accomplish this goal, continue to study it. The author of this essay is heavily in favor of continuing research into Venus, regardless of Venus' incredibly harsh conditions. That this is the main motivation for the writing of this essay is kept very clear throughout the text. To this end, the author makes his text well argued by providing varied and factual support in favor of studying Venus, such as Venus' similarities to Earth, its proximity, and one way scientists are considering surviving on Venus once they get there.

The author provides copious reasoning on why Venus is a planet well worth studying, but his primary argument is that Venus may have been the planet most similar to Earth at one point. This is a valuable point in the author's argument because it explains the similarities between Venus and the Earth, regardless that these similarities may be firmly in the past. For example, Venus may have supported life just as Earth does. Venus also has some features similar to those on Earth, such as mountains, craters, and valleys. These are important points, because the more similar a planet is to Earth, the easier it will be to survive there. This argument's aim is to show the reader that exploring Venus is a goal that could be beneficial to humanity in the future.

The other main point that the author provides is that Venus is, at times, the planet closest to Earth. The author goes so far as to say the planet ""is right around the corner"" in terms of space. Since space travel already has an impossibly long time frame, this is a crucial piece of information. Humans will not stop exploring outside the Earth, and that journey is sure to be difficult no matter what, but going to Venus might make the trip at least a little bit shorter, and therefore simpler. The reason for this particuar argument is that it makes the reader feel that going to Venus is much more reasonable than anywhere else.

The third reason the author's idea is well supported is that he gives a possible method for humans to survive on Venus. This reasoning is both specific and factual, describing a blimp like vehicle that would be located in the survivable part of Venus' atmosphere. However, the author also specifies that a hovering ship is not nearly enough to truly study a planet, and that NASA is already trying to find a method that would be superior. Both of these details give the reader the impression that Venus is truly an attainable goal. Futhermore, the reader is led into believing that if humanity is going to go to Venus, it needs to understand what it is going to.

In short, the author of this text wrote a well structured, well supported essay that pertained to why humans should explore Venus. There is next to no information that does not pertain to the chosen topic, which is a mark of a solid essay, but more importantly, he supports his ideas. The author describes the reasoning behind exploring Venus, rather than another planet. Furthermore, he specifies how such an act would be done. Together, these traits of the essay combine to make it very convincing and persuades the reader that exploring Venus would, in fact, be a worthy goal for humanity.",1,89c9e0ad072e4d3caf017b7703951537
"Individuality is the idea of freedom of thoughs, but why we are concerned what other people think? Let's be honest everybody had copied at least one time in a test or quiz just because it was more eassy to coppy than being trying to remember the anwer that obviously you did not know. We own our thoughs, thus, we should do ours ideas not somebody else's ideas

In the book called ""Maria Magdalena"" based in the movie ""The Davinci code"" states the ideas of one individual who thalk about the true behind the story about Maria Magdalena ( Jesus' mother). To catholic people Jesus's mother is saintly. Their sanctuary, the church. To the author of the book ""Maria Magdalena"" she is just a lie's layer. On those old times there were many poor people who were opressing by the church, they sufer in the church's hands. The church killed to protect the true behind Maria Magdalena. On those times existed the crusades in spanish the ""cruzadas"" in which the church fought the protestants to convert them in their cristianity if they negated to accept it they killed them. The victims decide to follow their own beliefs and the consequence was the death. This is a good example of individuality similar to our way to live in the present. The politics want us to do what they want to their advantages opressing our rights just like the church did with the protestants during the crusades. The author of ""Maria Magdalena was very brave to wrote about those things. He was very successful because nobody used to talk about this, now they do. In this book he shared us a little part of what was to be different from the others and take their own decitions. Based on this I state that we can share our ideas of individuality and do not let our corrups politics to opress people's rights.

In the present we have a huge amount of successful guys because of individuality. The influential ideas of the past are not in our day to day anymore. Parents now teach their offspring to take their own decitions knowing the consequences of this. Now we, the tenageers, are more prepared to develop our ideas and beliefs. Constantly, my mom develop the ideas of individuality in our family. One year ago I decided to start to work, and I am very proud of my decittion.

I remember my first day of kinder garden, All the kids playing and runnig around the field. To be honest, I prefer being painting rather than be runnig for no reason. My art's teacher gave us draws made by her.""Ready to paint"" she used to say, but I was so rebel that I made my own draws just because I though her draws were so bored. I was a little girl taking individuality decitions and I did not know it

In my conclusion I am agree with individuality, If we want to spread the individuality, then we should start saying what we think, because the bravery of the unexpected ones, will persuade the shyness ones. Individuality can be hard but not impossible. We live in a world with influencers that try to persuade us to be like them. Do not choose the easy way. I prefer the hard way, so then I would be proud of my achievement just like Ralph waldo Emerson said: ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplisment""",1,17e68b55c79546c38c9d48e4ae5f3453
"Space travel is not new to humanity nor is it something that has not already been accomplished. With the breach of Mars's soil having already occured scientist and space explorers have set their sights on the next challenge, Venus. Venus is sometimes closer to Earth than Mars and at other times Mars is the one closer to Earth, but of the two Venus is the closest match to Earth ""in terms of density and size"" and thus has been named Earth's ""twin"" making it a place of great interest for scientist, and those interested in space exploration because no other planet comes as close to matching Earth's conditions. Studying Venus could give hints about the future of Earth.

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author gives strong support to the idea that the pursuit of studying Venus is a worthy cause despite the dangers presented by the task. Knowledge of Venus would be extremely beneficial because Venus is one of the most interesting planets in Earth's solar system because of it's similarity to Earth. With the large number of similarities that Venus currently shares with Earth it wouldn't be terribly surprising or strange if Venus was once a planet ""covered largely with oceans and"" that ""could support various forms of life"". There is no way to tell if any of this is true, however without being able to travel to Venus and explore the planet. Only by exploring the planet and studying pieces of the planet such as small bits of land can noteworthy discoveries about Venus be made. Confirming or disproving the Earth-like Venus idea is not the only reason why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. Another reason is that ""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"" and the curiousity of humans and their travels on Earth ""should not be limited by dangers and doubts"" according to paragraph 8. This statements shows that gaining the ability to study the planet Venus is about more than just the planet and also expands to include the breaking of the limitations that stop exploration due to ""dangers"". By expanding to meet the challenge that Venus presents humans as whole will prove that they have the ability to explore and learn about nearly everything removing some of the limits of human exploration.

In conclusion the author's support of the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is extremely strong because the author gives noteworthy reasons as to how the pursuit would be beneficial to exploration and humans in general. The author states that the pursuit of studying Venus will open doors into the pursuit of studying other dangerous places, or areas of interest such as animals, and others. The author also sites the idea that more knowledge of the Earth's ""twin"" could in fact help give insight on Earth as well by giving humans an idea of what Earth could become in the future and perhaps by studying Venus scientist could find a way to prevent Earth from becoming Venus-like. The author's reasonings are strong and prove to be thought invoking and the author avoids the idea of risks that are not needed.",1,ea2af13d219341afb136a4e84b4a9935
"Working in a group is more benificial . Why is more beneficial working in a group ? because if you have a group your group can help you in ideas , writing ,examples and information. If you working alone you do not have someone who can supor your idea.

The benefits what you have working in a group. The benefits are you can talk with your group abuth the work and also you can hask cuesthions and you can talk abuth examples and than they can toldyou how they can do the work and the group can suport your ideas.

Working alone do not have to moch benefits. The benefits are you can use ideas of your shelf the other is not one goin to disturb you and you can put your examples but that will be more dificult because you need to find the information and not one goin to suport your ideas.

For example working in a group in high school the english teacher say the students goin to do groups of four. For do a progect the students say yes, one of those students say i will colect the information, the other say i goin to writing the information and the other say i will put the examples of the progect and other say i will reading the progect and also i goin to do a expocition in class is more good because you will stay more relax because the group is help you.

For example working alone in class, the high school teacher say we goin to do groups because we have a progect but if you want work alone you can do it. the student say i like work alone because no one goin to disturb in my work the studen can put ideas of him shelf but you do not have some one to talk abauth the progect. and you will have nebous inclass you will be distracted and boring.

Why some people do not like to work in groups? the people do not like work in groups becase they have problems with the people in the group meybe he do not feel well in the group or he feel some nervous in the group or because some people lika work in silent.

Why the most people like to work in groups? that is because the people like work with friends, he feel well talking with the group, he like answer the cuestions of the group.",1,cc138c226a5c41ad9a481791d573e7bd
"In today's society, when people are asked if they would give up their cars, they would be shocked. No would be the most common answer. However, the advantages of limiting car usage are great. General stress decreases, and polution to the environment also decreases. People are not only helping themselves, but also helping the ecosystem.

Stress. Everyone has it; but what if it could be decreased just by using personal transportation less? In Germany, there are certain communities that ban car usage. No cars are allowed inside the city. Street parking, driveways, and home garages have become obsolete. One citizen of one of the towns said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (

In German Suburbs

). The anxiety one gets when driving a car is almost unreal. Most kids 16 and up now just do not get their licenses just because the thought of driving scares them. Citizens of cities that have just one day where cares are prohibited, such as Bogota, Colombia, love that singular day out of the year. Most say its a good opportunity to increase mental health (

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota)

. Stress not only is awful for mental health, but also physical. 75% of those who have high levels of anxiety, or are exposed to it, are tired all the time, often feel weak, or sometimes may even cause heart issues. The number one reason people have stress is by driving. So using cars less is the best way to decrease stress, and promote good mental health.

Most people that read or watch the news know that the environment is hurt, and that the human population is at fault. How? Excess usage of motor vehicles. As stated in

In German suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. These statistics are horrible. Paris, France enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city after days of near-recorcd pollution rates (

Paris bans driving due to smog

) Not only was nature being hurt, but the population of France. Breathing in smog is unnatural. Thehuman body can not take that many polutants, and so it tries to fix itself. In doing this, lung cancer rates rise, pnumonia rates rise, diseases in general become more abundant. Paris took action. When enforcing the driving ban, congestion was down 60% in just five days. The only partial solution to this rising amount of smog is to decrease driving rates, and to use deisel gas less. I hate this test so much why am I even writing this I feel like a robot just going through the motions and its your fault. I blame you.

Rome was not built in a day, so getting state legislatiors or even government officials to agree on a partial driving rule may take a while. However, citizens can spread the word of the evils of driving. You, dear reader, can fix this problem. Try carpooling to work, riding your bike to places near you instead of driving. Do what you can to reduce polution and stress. Influence your friends and family to do the same. Together, we can rase awareness of the evils of driving. Together, we can rule the world.",1,5e19af4d914e442cbca97ba5e40d508a
"Using your phone while driving is dangerous. People should not be able to use a cellphone while driving because it is a hazard. People can die in car wrecks because they were on their phones while driving. People can get paralyzed by these car wrecks because of a cellphone. It is hypothesized that despite an effective way of communication, using cell phones during driving results in distracting attention of driver increasing road safety concerns.

Your main concern while your driving is that you obey the law and don't get in any wrecks. Your cellphone should not be your main concern while you are driving because it causes wrecks because your not paying attition to the road. Most wreck are because of people on their cellphones. About 421,000 people are injured in wrecks caused by texting and driving. Texting and driving are the number one reason for wrecks in the US.

Texting and driving has its pros and cons. One pro is that you could get a text about an emergency and you could possibly save someones life. Another pro is that if your lost then you can look up where you have to go or get directions. Some of the cons are that you can get in wrecks, get injured, and even die because you were texting and driving. You should be able to be on your phone is there is bad traffic or if your at a red light.

Having your phone out while your driving is illegal now because of the risks of doing so. You cant even eat or drink while driving because of the hazards. Texting and driving is no joke. It is the number one cause for wrecks in the world and it can also take your life. I think that texting and driving should be illegal because if your lost or have to text somebody you can always pull over to the side of the road and use your phone because you can put not only your life at risk, but everyone else that is in the car as well.",1,3b0de85575d843a5b4f7b7ec21325e0a
"The Electoral College is a system which was established to elect the president of the United States of America. In this system, each state receives a group of electors. The number of electors each state is awarded is based on the representation a state has in Congress. The total number of electors per state equals the number of people a state has in the House of Representative plus the two senators a state has. In a state, the electors pledge to vote for the candidate who wins the popular vote. This system is simply unneeded in modern times and is unneccesarily complicated. The Electoral College must be abolished.

To commence, the Electoral College should be eradicated because it is simply unreliable. The result of a direct election would be more transparent and would make the citizens of this country certain the election was democratic and just. The issue lies in the fact that voters are technically only voting for electors to cast a vote for a candidate, and not for a candidate themselves. These electors pledge to vote in favor of the candidate who rightly wins the popular vote in a state, but some attempt to be defiant. For instance, according to Bradford Plumer's article, ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy"" (11). If the Lousiana legislature was successful in their attempt to be defiant, electoral votes would not go to Kennedy despite him winning the popular vote in that state. Another way in which the Electoral College is unreliable is that it allows for a tied vote. There are 538 electoral votes in the system currently in use, meaning it is possible for two candidates to receive 269 votes each. This may seem unlikely, but it is more likely to occur than some might think. For instance, as according to Plumer's aforementioned article, an electoral tie would have occured in 1968 if only 41,971 more votes were for the losing candidate. Additionally, in the 1976 election, if 5,559 voters in the swing state of Ohio, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had simply voted in favor of the candidate with the minority of the votes, a tie would have occured. In order to resolve a tie, the House of Representatives casts votes to decide the winner of the election. At this point, the impact of each representative is skewed so representatives of states with lower population can more easily decide the state's vote. This happens because each state only votes once, so the few representatives of a small state such as Nebraska can decide who to vote for rather easily, while in California, 55 representatives with different views must colloborate to cast a single vote. With so much unreliability, why is the outdated system of the Electoral College still in use?

Furthermore, the Electoral College must be abolished because it does not properly refelct the views of the nation. Citizens' wishes will not always be equivalent to what the electors vote for. This occurs partly because of the winner-take-all system. In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winner-take-all system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn't make sense. The winner-take-all system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won't allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled ""swing states"". With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a toss-up carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner's article in favor of this corrupt system, ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion..."" (21). While it might seem reasonable for larger states to have a larger impact than smaller states, it simply isn't a fair way to go about having an election. Voters should each have the same impact, and they would have exactly that in a direct election. Presently, voters in Florida, for instance, have more impact on the election than a voter in Wyoming. Supporters also claim the focus on swing states is beneficial because residents of swing states should be more politically informed due to their state's importance in the election. This notion is simply a fabrication in order to make the Electoral College seem as if it causes America to be more informed, because there would be no need for residents of specific states to pay closer attention to candidates than residents of others if a direct election were to take place. The Electoral College does not properly reflect the desire of the nation's population, and thus should be replaced.

In retrospect, the Electoral College must be abolished. It is an inherently unfair system and it does not reflect the views of American voters.",1,6a6107ae54534400a535eeb2544d3857

In life being a negavtive person isn't a good solution if you to be success in life. A person with a negative mindset would have bed thought in their mind. For example"" you can't do this"" or "" just give up on life"" . you won't have enough confidence to accomlished your goal. If you are a negative person then you should get some help or go talk to someone help. So, you can become a better positive person.

A positive attitude help you to be something in the future. It's give you happiness and make life easier. You won't be upset thinking "" did i do this right "" or "" am i good enough "". Also, with a psitive mindset you will want to keep trying unitl you make it. when you a positive person ; people would want to be around you. You will have the best confidence you need to rech your goal.

"Dear Senator, The debate regarding the necessity of the Electoral College and it's validity has aroused some tension among the citizens of America, and the government as well. This process is not only used to decide the President of our nation, but to ensure the equality of the voting. By establishing our county as a democracy, we made a promise to maintain a systematic balance between the government and it's people. Without the existence of the Electoral College, where would this balance be? The Electoral College is the basis upon which our country is built, and is vital to uphold the balance and equality between government and people.

The Electoral College has many benefits towards the nation that many people are unaware of. For example, in order to do well, a candidate must have connections nationwide. In source 3, line 19, it states ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal."" This means that no candidate is guaranteed a win if they only appeal to one area or region. This creates an overall balance throughout the nation, and makes sure only a portion of the country doesn't have all the power. Also, this allows the people to have a clear understanding of who they're voting for, and what this means.

Equality is key, and without this equality, where would our nation be? By continuing the use of the Electoral College, we have decided to be the best we can be. It says in Source 1, line 1 ""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and the election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" This provides valid information to support the necessary balance of people and government.

The Electoral College also produces a winner arguably qualified due to the amount of votes received. This is clearly described in Source 3, line 22, ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" Due to the use of this process, the election of a President can be efficient and simple. The President can now be Some may argue that this process does not clearly represent the people or their votes. This is because some may vote for a ""slate of electors"" as opposed to the president. However, this belief can be decidedly rejected due to the lack of valid evidence to support the claim. How are voters expected to vote fairly if they are not given the support to do so?

Overall, it can be declared that the Electoral College plays a vital role in maintaining the internal balance of our nation that the citizens inhabiting it are so reliant on. Choosing to reject this process would be deciding to injure our nation, its future, and its people.",1,249527d9155e4dec898335de4d399091

"The importance of mental health in teenagers today cannot be overstated. With the rise of social media, teens all around the world are increasingly exposed to a variety of stressful and challenging situations that can cause mental health issues if not addressed in time. From exam pressures to cyberbullying, it is essential for young people to have access to quality information about their emotional and psychological well-being. Mental health care begins with education; parents, educators, and guardians should strive to educate young people on how best to recognize symptoms early on so they can seek out appropriate help when needed. Furthermore, providing support systems such as counseling sessions or peer groups can be crucial in helping teens learn how cope with difficult emotions and situations they may face in life while also teaching them valuable communication skills. It is important that adolescents understand that seeking professional help does not need to carry any stigma or shame associated with it - rather it should be seen as an opportunity for growth and development both mentally and emotionally by learning healthy ways of managing stress levels. Additionally, parents should make sure their children know that there is no shame in asking for assistance from outside sources- whether this means seeing a therapist or joining a support group - having someone knowledgeable available who can offer objective advice based on your individual situation will definitely prove beneficial down the line. Lastly, remember that everybody experiences different levels of difficulty throughout their teenage years; however being able act responsibly towards one’s own wellbeing through proper self-care measures such as getting enough sleep at night or exercising regularly is paramount when dealing with life’s challenges during adolescence. Embracing these lifestyle changes now will surely leave positive long term effects later down the road!

Owning a hamster is no exception; while they may seem small and low-maintenance, there is still quite a bit that goes into keeping them healthy and happy. If you're considering getting a hamster as your next pet, you'll need to think about the costs associated with their care. Besides purchasing food for your new friend, cages or habitats are also necessary in order to give them adequate space to explore and exercise safely. Allowing your hamster plenty of time outside its cage is important too; although these animals are largely nocturnal creatures, they still appreciate having some sort of stimulation during daylight hours that only comes from being allowed out for short periods at regular intervals throughout the day. Aside from monetary considerations related to housing and supplies for your furry companion, there are medical needs which must be taken into account as well; annual check ups by either an exotics vet or even just a general practitioner will help ensure any potential health issues with your pet don't go unnoticed before they become problematic. Of course if something does arise between visits then prompt veterinary attention should always be sought in order to best guarantee that everything stays on track with regards to health maintenance overall. . It's equally important not forget what joys come along with owning any type of pet: using treats can offer up opportunities for bonding between critter and human alike! For those who opt towards taking this route when interacting with their hamsters – which isn't essential but certainly appreciated by most – it's wise to keep things like variety within snack items so as not risk upsetting sensitive stomachs (or worse). As long as owners remember all the basics such as providing proper nutrition via dietary staples ideal for rodent species plus making certain appropriate bedding/habitat materials are

"While the idea that the Face on Mars was sculpted by aliens is intriguing, the evidence strongly suggests it is simply a natural landform formed through normal geological processes. Several key facts support the view that it was not created by an intelligent civilization.

Firstly, high resolution images of the Face reveal that it lacks distinguishing features like eyes, nose or mouth that would indicate an intelligent design. Upon closer inspection, the supposed facial features disappear and it looks more like an uneven rocky slope than anything resembling a sculpture. If aliens had crafted it, they likely would have included finer details that clearly conveyed its intended facial appearance. 

Secondly, the material the Face is made from, the iron-rich rock known as hematite, commonly forms mesa-like ridges and angels through weathering and erosion alone. Hematite is extremely vulnerable to wind abrasion which causes it to break down into subtle sloping patterns over time. These natural forces can easily account for how the Face's rough outline came to resemble a facial profile even without any intentional sculpting. 

Lastly, many other non-facial landforms have been discovered on Mars that formed through purely natural geological processes yet look vaguely like animals or people from afar. Unless we are expected to believe aliens purposely sculpted all kinds of fake faces and figures across the Martian surface to deceive us, the simplest explanation is that these formations were gradually shaped by environmental conditions, not intelligent design. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, yet none has been found to prove alien intervention in shaping the Face.

In conclusion, while the idea of aliens visiting Mars sparks our imagination, the scientific evidence clearly points to the Face being the result of normal geological weathering and erosion over eons. Its formation can be fully explained without invoking speculative theories of artificial sculpting. Unless more concrete proof surfaces, it is best to accept the Face as just another fascinating natural wonder of the Red Planet.",0,cf2e0ef4643046b4b1f6cffedfdb2a95
"Do you think the Facial Action Coding is 100 percent valuable and correct? In my personal opinion I say no. I have three reason that can explain why this technology is not valuable. I could be frowning and be happy ,but showing a sign of joy. Don't always trust technology; it sometimes can lead in the wrong way. Im amuse that people are relying on technology to lead them in a direction that could be wrong.

In the article it said "" For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feelging simply by the look on her face."" That's very incorrect because many times I'll ask my friend how she is feeling when she looks grumpy. She would say im good with me not knowing that because me thinking her facial expression is saying something different. People ask me all the time whats wrong with me when; I turn out to be just chilling. Some people natural look might just be a mug. I learned that the hard way its so very true.

Trusting technology can give you false information. I remember this time I sprained my foot. I went to the doctor to get in x-ray and the x-ray information was showing that nothing was wrong with it for a period of time. Although, im glad the doctor knew what he was doing ;he then figure out that the inner of my foot was spained. The bone was slightly bent and I needed time to heal it and recover. It sounds like the Facial Action Coding System is like a x-ray machine.

I understand that the Facial Action Coding System is a use of technology. With that being known we can believe that the technology want always be right. You can get stuff off the internet thats not true information, but yet it's a source of technology. Many people just go to get there information off of wikipedia for a research project. You never know if the stuff is true because any one can edit it. So you can compare the Facial Action Coding Sysytem with gettig information off of the internet these are both sources of technology.

Is it a possibility that the Facial Coding System is valuable? Yes but I wouldn't put all of my trust into it. Just because im frowning don't assume that something is wrong with me. Or if someone just has a mug as a look don't think that their mad. It can come back that your wrong. Believeing that everything with technology is true is very false. It a good chance that the technology is off. The Facial Coding Sysytem like a x-ray scanning. Sometimes it can give true information sometimes it can't.",1,cd537a809961498f8b7c2ca1d31e6fd0
"Should the school board add one and a half hours to school each day?

School should not be extended any longer than it already is! Although the school board may think that school should be one hour and a half longer, students and parents believe that school hours should remain the same. I do not agree with the school board planning to add one hour and half every school day. School by its self puts a lot of pressure on the students and with a hour added its going to be much more difficult.

The school board should not add hours to school, since students are already used to the hours they get out of school. With a hour and a half students would probably get to much pressure on dealing with some school material. Students would also get much more school work. They would also get an hour taken away to spend that time with the family. It would also take time for the students to get used to leaving school an hour later! If the school hours remain the same then students would already be used to the hour schedule, and they would also have time to do after school activities!!

Because the school board wants to add an hours more of school, the school board should listen to the parents and not add another hour. It would give students much more stress. Without an hour added, it would give so much relief to alot of parents that wont have to fight for what they believe the school board should do with the time schedule.",1,5965c30cf64649f290582b2f4b498ee3

"If you wanted advice who would you talk to? When people seek multiple opinions it can help someone make better choices. i agree with this because people attend to help others and be there with you when you need someone to talk to. And also help you to make better choices for you.

My first reason is that it helps you think what choices are best for you when you need them. second, people that know you well like for an example your family, knows what's right or wrong for you. so you dont have to worry of what they're going to say. Because they know that they wont make you think more. finally, you will hear multiple opinions to hear from. Until you feel that you agree with any opinion. and knowing that it could help you prevent anything that could happen in the future when you need it.

My second reason is that it could help you get rid of the negative thoughts and thinking less when you know you have multiple advice and opinions. second, the more people you have by your side are the best choices you make. because they support you and will give you great advice. And also giving small talks (advice). because they know how you feel and know what you like to hear from others. finally, it could help to improve ideas and thoughts you might ve had in your head. because you think how you plan out your ideas without making a mistake.

My third reason is you have a chance to make better choices when you get advice from others. And it could also help not to make mistakes. And that the one of reasons you get advice is because you learn from your mistakes whether its something bad or good. second people who offer you advice, often could lead you to a right path. if you trust them. Mostly people who gets lead to a right path often listens to people's advice and follows their heart to whats right or wrong for them. And usually thinks if it's worth it or not. finally you dont have to be alone when you need advice because their always that one person that is there for you to talk to even if you dont seem them familiar.

We all ask for opinions right? and its normal that we do because it could help us during life. Not everybody gets that chance like we do because some people been doing by their own and thats totally fine you could also do that but having others help you and giving you multiple options is a way easier to get a better future i know not all of might not agree with that and its fine because all people have different ideas!.

In conclusion, advice could take people anywhere even if you dont believe me. But it does. having a good variety of choices is better than having none. Because the good choices could take you to a better future, better education and good career. but having none could take no where. Unless you ask for some advice trust me you wont regret it. we only live once, try to make good life deiscions by letting others give you advice.",1,b1474273b51248319aafbc4b1f048245
"There are a number of reasons why younger people may enjoy life more than older people do. One reason is that young people are more likely to be in good health than older people. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people over the age of 65 are more likely to have at least one chronic condition, such as heart disease, diabetes, or arthritis. Young people are also more likely to be physically active and to eat a healthy diet.

Another reason why young people may enjoy life more than older people is that they are more likely to have a positive outlook on life. A study by the University of California at San Diego found that people who are optimistic are more likely to be happy and to enjoy life more than people who are pessimistic. Young people are more likely to be optimistic than older people, because they have not had as much experience with disappointment and failure.

A third reason why young people may enjoy life more than older people is that they are more likely to have a strong social network. A study by the University of Michigan found that people who have strong social ties are more likely to be happy and to enjoy life more than people who do not have strong social ties. Young people are more likely to have strong social ties than older people, because they are more likely to be in school or in the workforce, and to have a large group of friends.

There are a number of reasons why young people may enjoy life more than older people do. One reason is that young people are more likely to be in good health than older people. Another reason is that young people are more likely to have a positive outlook on life. A third reason is that young people are more likely to have a strong social network.

The advent of online school has ushered in a new era for young scholars. The potential benefits of online school are manifold—it can make higher education more accessible to students with disabilities or illnesses, provide a more flexible learning environment for students, and open up opportunities for them to gain employment. On the other hand, some drawbacks of online school should not be overlooked. The prevalence of technology in every home is not a given, thus access to computers and the internet can be quite a challenge for many students, particularly in some socio-economic communities. Nevertheless, the potential for online school to help both those with disabilities or illness and the economy, should not be discounted. With the right technological infrastructure and support, online school could become an option for all school districts, allowing students to access educational opportunities that would otherwise be unavailable.",0,9db2770a3a364d9ba97dc8e1a8b3047e
"Human emotion can be expressed by many things such as body language, tone, and language. Emotion allows us to understand others and empathize easier. A software known as Facial Action Coding System has been developed to improve accuracy of calculating the emotions of others. Using this technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is invaluable because humans already can ""calculate"" emotions, the classroom is not taught by a computer, and human emotions are very complex.

The first reason that the FACS is invaluable to the classroom is because there is no need to use technology to ""calculate"" emotions of a student. A classroom consists of a teacher and several students which are humans. The author stated within the article, ""humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day,"" He further on states that we can probably tell how a friend feels just by the look on their face. Since humans can already perceive and understand emotions of others, there is no need for a mode of technology to figure out when someone is bored or confused about certain subjects in a classroom. When a student is bored or confused about a certain subject, he or she could simply ask for help from a teacher or a peer. Using the FACS technology would be redundant in reading emotional expressions of students; Therefore, it is invaluable technology.

Computers are not what teach students in a classroom. The author tells the reader to imagine a classroom computer that could recognize your emotions, so it could ""modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" There is always a human instrcutor( the teacher) in a classroom, so there should not be a need for a modification of a lesson by a computer when the teacher can modify the lesson. Students do not need to be dependent on a computer to learn what they need to learn in a classroom, and a computer that can calculate emotion is obsolete by its uselessness in the manner of learning.

The final reason why emotion calculating technology is invaluable in a classroom is that emotion is too complex for just a classroom computer to calculate. First of all, emotion differs from person to person. In the aritcle Dr. Huang, a professor of the University of Amsterdam, said, ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal,"" but he also stated, ""individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" If emotional expressions are all unique, it would be very difficult for computers to calculate the exact feeling a students is feeling just by their facial expression. Also, in the seventh paragraph, the author stated, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" This means that the classroom computer would not be able to calculate like how it was used in the article.

In conclusion, the FACS is too redundant and under developed to be of any use for a classroom enviorment. It is invaluable and there are mulitple substitutes that can read emotional expressions of students in a school. In the future, with further innovations, there will be a time where classrooms use this type of technology to enhance education; but as of right now, the system is not useful for helping classrooms teach students.",1,fbb292d809654782a8a8cdc73739e5d7

"Thick, foggy air is the future for this planet if we continue on this polluting path. Although, pollution is unavoidable in the industrial time we all live in. There are still ways people may help to limit the amount of pollution. With this information,the people of the earth need to limit their use of cars. For benefiting reasons such as, decreasing the deadly pollution, the lessening of stress, and economically saving.

Initialy, Pollution is increasing drastically and limiting car use will help decrease it. The usual effects of pollution from a car is the exhaust it lets out. Also, the factories that manufacture these cars are letting off smoke which in result pollutes the air people breath. In source 1 paragraph 5, it explains that passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to fifty percent in some surbuban countries such as the United States. Therefore, the result of cars exhaust is hurting the enviroment and is one of the main causes of greenhouse gases. Source 2 paragraph 15, also states the cold nights and warm nights caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Explaining the air families and children breath is basically coming form a car's exhaust. Overall, pollution is a catastrophe and affects evryone dramatically.

Additionally, the stress of the average person can and will be lowered if the use of cars decrease. Stress can be cause by many things, but one of those things is the use of cars. Limiting the use of cars will really help any person relax. source 1 paragraph 3, Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, states she has been less tense and is much happier. Futher more without the use of a car this mother feels relaxed which enables her to be the mothe she wants to me. Source 3 paragraph 20 explains that leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. Knowing how stressful a traffic jam can be, limiting the use of a car will avoid that stress. To conclude, the strees releif of limiting the use of a car will impact evryone in a very beneficial way.

Lastly, there is an economic benefit to limiting the use of a car. A car cost alot to maintain and with all these expenses, its hard to find money to spend on ones self. Source 4, paragraph 32 explains the car use decreasing in america was caused by recession. The cash strapped americans had a hard time finding the money to spend on cars, which explains cars are a very expenxive product. Overall, the ecnomic impact will be beneficial to everyone because of the money saved to be used for different amenities.

To sum up, the limiting use of cars wont only help relieve stres or save money, but also help decrease pollution. Everyone would then be able to live a life knowing their childrens future will be bright. Instead of full with smog and smoke.",1,e579dff16e8c4cc5986cf02b197aae1e
"The Face on Mars is just a natural landform. If you think that the face is an evidence that theres life on Mars, then think about how they got there and how advance their technology would have to be. The face is just a natural landform because on paragraph 12 it says, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West""(Unmasking of the Face on Mars,12).

You may think that it is evidence that life exist on Mars. I respect that. You got some good evidence, some scienctists even believe that too. That the face is an alien artifact.

Recent research has indicated that there are many potential benefits to having students engage in litter pickup and community service, such as fostering a stronger connection to the community and increasing social-emotional skills. These activities can even help to build leadership skills and reduce feelings of helplessness in teenagers. For parents, there are also peace of mind benefits. Knowing their teens are involved in community service activities with positive adult oversight can help foster mature decision-making. 

However, there are some risks associated with these activities. For example, some students may not be comfortable or feel safe doing such activities alone. In addition, these activities can become costly for cash-strapped school districts. Finally, they are labor-intensive tasks that administrators must manage to ensure safety and compliance with state guidelines. 

Given this research, it is clear that proactively engaging students in community service activities can certainly have a positive effect on a student's physical and mental health, and can create a stronger sense of camaraderie and involvement in their community. However, school administrators must put safety and cost considerations first, ensuring that both students and school staff are comfortable with the activities and that the added costs are covered. With careful consideration and proper oversight, it is possible that principals should require students to participate in these activities.",0,95bd0e52c64a45929d0ef180e593eb93
"All of these articles share the central idea of minimalizing pollution where most of it comes from: cars. In the first source, they talk about how a city was created where cars are nonexistant, and people walk everywhere, a city called Vauban. This city is in Germany and consists of 5,500 people in a sqaure mile area. Doing so in the creation of this city has cut down a major part of pollution in the surrounding area.

These methods of erradicating as much pollution as possible are making a substantial amount of progress, considering the densities of these cities and countries participating in this pollution expuslion effort. In Paris, France, they had an entire day where cars weren't allowed to be used in anyway or a massive fine would be administered. For the first day, people with even numbered liscene plates weren't allowed to drive, then the odd numbered the next day. Many people complained and didn't even go to work those days. Many trucking compaines complained about a loss in revenue and being behind on work, and dozens of people were drastically fined. This did cut down on the amount of smog in Paris, though, and really cleaned out a lot of the city. It had gotten so bad in Paris that the pollution levels were around the ones in Bejing, the most polluted city in the world.

In Bogota, Colombia, driving was also banned for a day, but not because of high pollutions levels in the area, but because the city feels they should do their part in helping the enviorment. Every year they set up a day when they won't drive, no matter rain, snow, any inconvience at all, is overlooked. They feel that the enviorment is more important than getting a little wet or being a little too cold, all of which are never permanant. The only form of car-like transport allowed was city buses, which even then weren't used very often besides by children or the elderly.

America is also doing their part in eliminating pollution, but are completely unaware of their doing so. The younger generation of America doesn't feel driving is at all of an imporance as other generations do. Many of these people don't have a drivers license and aren't planning on doing so for a long time. America has generally passed it's peak driving point in 2005 and is slowly decreasing in the purchase of cars, and drivers licenses.",1,a58491898e8e426b97f9dba1cec9d0a3
"The Law of Conservation of Energy is a cornerstone concept in Physics and science in general. It states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but rather it can only change forms. This law has been used to explain phenomena from the smallest particles to stars and galaxies, inspiring countless scientific discoveries throughout history. Recently, this discovery has also been applied to more everyday situations as well, such as personal finance and sustainability efforts. The law of conservation of energy states that if one form of energy is lost due to some process (such as heat dissipation), then an equal amount must become available in another form (such as mechanical work). In terms of finances, this means that although money may come into your life through income sources like a paycheck or gift cards; it will eventually leave you through costs associated with living expenses like rent and food. Therefore instead of thinking about managing money solely on an income basis; it's important to understand how spending habits influence savings over time. For example, if you want to save for retirement or build wealth then learning how to live below your means will go a long way towards reaching those goals sooner than later since not all money coming in needs to go out so quickly!. . Sustainability initiatives are increasingly reliant on the understanding that resources should not be wasted unnecessarily since they are limited - something which can easily be understood by applying the Law Of Conservation Of Energy principle: no matter what we do with resources today they won't increase tomorrow unless we make them renewable or find ways for them replenish themselves over time (which often involves significant effort). By being mindful about how our actions affect both current & future generations; individuals have greater power when making decisions regarding their lifestyle choices because they know these decisions could potentially impact everyone down the line. Overall, The Law Of Conservation Of Energy provides us with insight into many aspects of our lives including financial planning and sustainability practices alike - enabling us thoughtfully consider our present actions & plan strategically for future outcomes without

"The rise of alternatives to traditional cars, such as electric vehicles, car-sharing services, and public transportation, has led some to predict that there will be fewer cars on the road in the coming years. While it is difficult to predict the future with certainty, there are several reasons why this prediction might be accurate. 

Firstly, the shift towards electric vehicles is gaining momentum. As technology improves, electric cars are becoming more affordable and practical for everyday use. Governments are also incentivizing the adoption of electric vehicles by offering tax credits and other benefits. The number of electric vehicles on the road is expected to increase dramatically in the coming years, and this trend could lead to a reduction in the number of traditional gas-powered cars in use. 

Secondly, car-sharing services are becoming more popular, particularly in urban areas. Services like Zipcar and Car2Go allow people to rent cars by the hour or day, rather than owning their own vehicle. This option is often more cost-effective than owning a car, particularly for people who only need a vehicle occasionally. As car-sharing services continue to expand, there may be less demand for individual car ownership, which could lead to a decrease in the total number of cars in use. 

Finally, public transportation is becoming more efficient and accessible. Many cities are investing in high-speed rail systems, buses, and other forms of public transportation that make it easier for people to get around without a car. As public transportation improves, more people may opt to use it instead of owning a car, particularly in densely populated areas where traffic congestion is a problem. 

While there are certainly factors that could lead to fewer cars on the road in the future, it is important to note that there are also factors that could lead to an increase in the number of cars in use. For example, as the global population continues to grow, there may be more demand for personal transportation. Additionally, as developing countries continue to industrialize, there may be a greater need for cars to support economic growth. 

In conclusion, while it is difficult to predict the future with certainty, there are several reasons to believe that there will be fewer cars in use in the coming years. The rise of electric vehicles, car-sharing services, and public transportation are all factors that could contribute to this trend. However, it is important to consider the potential counterarguments and recognize that there are also factors that could lead to an increase in the number of cars in use.

"Laws are sets of rules and regulations that dictate how people should behave, interact, and conduct themselves in a specific situation. They are meant to ensure order and stability, and as such, are often rigid and fixed. However, while this approach is beneficial in some cases, I believe that laws should not be rigid or fixed but rather be flexible enough to take account of various circumstances, times, and places.

Flexibility is an essential part of the law making process and should be taken into account when deciding on laws. This is because every situation is unique and requires a specific legal response. For example, if a law is intended to address a certain issue and it turns out that the current legislation is not applicable to the case, there needs to be flexibility in order to adopt the law to the circumstances. Otherwise, the law remains ineffective and fails to address the issue at hand. Additionally, laws should be flexible to adapt to the changing times and social context. For instance, the law against discrimination is a prime example of how laws need to adapt to the changing times and changing values, as it is important for the law to reflect society’s evolving view on what is and isn’t acceptable.

Flexible laws also provide the advantage of being able to adjust to the particular needs of a certain place. For example, while one country may have laws regulating the use of certain drugs, another may have laws that are more permissive or restrictive. The laws should be able to take account of the different needs and contexts of each place in order to create laws that are effective and fair. Furthermore, laws should be flexible enough to provide different levels of punishments depending on the severity of the crime. For instance, the penalty for a minor infraction should be different from the penalty for a serious offence. This ensures that there is an appropriate level of punishment for each crime, making the law just and effective.

In conclusion, I believe that laws should not be rigid or fixed but rather be flexible enough to take account of various circumstances, times, and places. This is because every situation is unique, and laws should be able to adapt to changing times and places in order to be effective. Flexible laws also provide the advantage of being able to adjust to the particular needs of a certain place, and provide different levels of punishments depending on the severity of the crime. Thus, I strongly believe that laws should be flexible and not rigid or fixed.

"How would exploring venus be dangerous? Well first of all in the text is states that the planets surface is an average of over 800 degrees fahrenheit. Thats pretty hot compared to the temperatures that we get here in the US. Some countries may be hotter than others but no one is near 800 degrees. That would be a very dangerous trip for any one knowing how hot it is there. It also states that the atmospheric acid pressure ios 90 times greater that what we experience on pur own planet. It also states that this type of environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Yes I agree that many people would want to see up close what things are on Venus but now in time there is no way that we could get a human up there and get samples of things mainly becuase of the pressure and the temperature.

Studying Venus is a definant worth pursuit but like i said earlier the teperature and the pressure is to hard for any human to get up there. Getting even a rock from Venus would help us learn things about the planet that we may not even know about today. They said in the passage that they have gotten robots out to venus but that is still hard to tell anything because Venus is a very cloudy planet, but even with a robot it is still hard to tell anything because of the fact that robots are good but they can't always work the way that you want them to work. In the passage it asks why scientists are discussing further visits to its surface? thats a good question that I would even ask them. The answer to that question is that astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well one have been the most Eart-like planet in ur solar system. It says that long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. From what people and scientists have said today about Venus it doesn't sound like it has that anymore. If it is 800 degrees on that planet all the oceans are gone and I don't think that they will return because of that. If your planet is 800 degrees all your oceans are dried up and any type of water is dried up as well.

I agree with the claim that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. If you go to Venus you will most likely die but if you don't go how are we going to study anything from that planet, and how are we going to learn anything about the planet itself. It says in the passage striving to meet the challenges presented by venus has values, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but shold be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. In the is paragraph is is saying that even though venus would be very hard to research that we should saty with venus and one day be able to go their and study. even if it is dangerous, some sientists want to go their even for the danger that it may constist of. Going to Venus would be awesome but at the same time I don't know if going their for the risks that it has would be the smartest thing to do. You could go their and 5 minutes leater be dead. I wouldn't want to do that because I would want to live. Some people are different than me because they like adventure and getting out of their comfort zone but for me that wouldn't be the case.

Going to venus would be a huge sucess but the risks that it has I don't know if going their is worth it. Being able to study everything that it has on the planet would be huge. Learing about the things that go on there would also be huge to know. In the end If you as an individual would like to go the Venus and study the planet and the things that go on their you should go for it even at the dangers that it holds. If you are the type of person that enjoys adventure and learning about new things, I would say that this is the type of adventure that you would want to go on. I say this because of the simple reason that Venus has never been searched in depth, I mean in paragraphy two it states that spacecrafts that have landed their have only been able to survive for a few hours. obviously you could explore a little bit with this amount of time but with an entire planet it would be hard to only have a few hours to explore. you could definantly get a decent way with a few hours but because its an entire planet it would be very hard to discover new things because the craft can't go very fast and the craft can't move as fast as a human would be able to with a few hours. would you rather have multiple humans go out their and research or would you rather have one spacecraft go and research only one way for a few hours. Even if the humans know that they most likely would survive for very long. they could grab somethings that they could put into the shuttle and then the shuttle would return home and the scientists would be able to study later wen the shuttle returns home with all the possible things that the astronauts found on Venus. If Humans went out on a mission to study it states that 97 perscent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, and the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmostphere. (Paragraphy3) You know how hard it would be for someone to survive in that type of weather. If you send a astronaut to go and research you are basically asking one of you men to go up there and risk his life to study what is up there.

In the passage it says that Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin But I disagree with that statement. Venus is way more toxic and way for dangerous for humans to go up and study. For one thing the temperature is way to high and the amount of chemicals that could possibly kill you are things that are way to dangerous for any human to go and study. If you send a man up there you are asking him to die to research things that could be useful. if you step onto venus's land you are most likely going to die because of the difference on everything from what your used to. even is suits you are most likely going to die because of the differences. I know I wouldn't want to die.",1,daffdf584b3647adb884c49b0c9267e1
"""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" Plumer, Source 2. Many do not like the electoral college for these reasons and many others such as it can be a disaster or because it is just plain dumb. Also there are a few reasons why the electoral college should be kept such as avoiding runoff elections or big states, but those not in favor of it out weigh those in favor of it. The people who despise the electoral college are in favor of popular vote since it is the better choice.

For various reasons the electoral college is unfair such as not everyones decisions count just those few people in the electoral college. In a popular vote election everyones vote counts not just those who are considered better than us because they hold authority over people. Those people can also be sneaky and can change votes to be in favor of their choice of president. They will even take bribes sometimes just because they can even though us other people do count.

The system should not even be here today because it is outdated way past our time. ""It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolsi the electoral college!"" Plumer, Source 2 and many others do agree with this statement because it rather true that we do so instead of let a bunch of monkeys run our states and country, but I am pretty sure that sometimes they could even do a better job than those in office right now. "".....over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" Plumer, Source 2 every day as we continue that percentage continues to grow and that data was recorded in 2000.

Lastly, the electoral college is irrational like seriously what idiotic person came up with this. I will say this again, but a monkey could of made a better system than this. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president........Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, soemtimes the presidential candidate themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. DO voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candiate? Sometimes"" Plumer, Source 2 I know this statement says it all because how could one simply not want popular vote after reading this.

I know that electoral college vote can help and not cause problems, but there are more problems while there is one easy fix which is popular vote. ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" Plumer, Source 2.",1,12aa6a5bc9fb4da8ac8075e7b55fe4ee
"In the article unmasking the face on Mars NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet,snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2,when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.

It was an enorumous head nearly two miled from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet calle Cydonia.

I dont think the face was real in the first place because the face is really blurry and its half in the ground.

NASA knew it wasent real when they unvelied the image for all to see.

The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.

""But the sensation was short lived.""

""Scientists figured it was just another Martian messa, common enough around Cydonia,only this one had unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon.

It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years.

What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around american west.",1,612dda18053a46358c0cd8c31b76e87a
"The Pareidolia Phenomenon: Debunking Claims of the ""Face on Mars""

While images of planetary surfaces often spark our imagination, seeing patterns where none truly exist can lead us astray. Such is the case with the so-called ""Face on Mars."" Upon closer examination, evidence shows it is a product of pareidolia rather than alien intervention.

Some claim the symmetrical outline and features of the landform are too precise to be natural. However, the article provides geological context showing how erosion Sculpted the hills in the Cydonia region over millions of years. The effects of wind, weather and subtle differences in rock composition create gradients that play tricks on our perception. Over vast spans of martian history, it is not surprising some formations may resemble crude faces when viewed from above. 

They also argue shadows and lighting make this formation look like it has eyes, a nose and mouth. Yet when NASA's Mars Global Surveyor observed it under different sunlight, the illusion faded. Without shadows to guide the eye, it looks like countless other nondescript Martian mesas. Pareidolia is known to flourish where lighting creates contrast and suggestion - not proof of artificial design.

Finally, some say the improbability of such an arrangement points to alien artistry. But probability means little when nature has had billions of years and a whole planet to work with. Even seeming coincidences become inevitable given endless attempts. Before jumping to assumptions of extraterrestrial sculptors, a natural geological origin best fits the scientific evidence and processes we understand to have shaped Mars over aeons. 

In the end, seeing more than what is really there is human nature. But as scientists, we must follow evidence, not wishes, and accept that sometimes a rock is just a rock. The ""Face on Mars"" presents an intriguing optical deception but no proof of an alien presence. Its origin is, as for so many wonders of our solar system, rooted in the complex interplay between geology and time.",0,c497c2d271ce4be0bc071551781daad3
"Current day, almost everyone owns a cell phone. When using a cell phone, you are easily distracted. For instance, say you are on vacation and you were looking for a restaurant on your phone and fell in the water. But, if you're easily distracted while walking, imagine how much more distracting you'd be in a car. There's a right time for your phone, the car is not one.

When you're driving, you not only have to be aware of yourself, but your surroundings. Including construction, other drivers, and pedestrians. Already as a driver it's hard to stay focused when you have passengers and/or playing music. Now picture you're driving down the road and see a man on his phone hit a kid on a bike and speed off afterwards. There are many safety hazards while driving and adding a phone into the equation, only adds more. Georgia has just now recently added the ""Hands Free"" rule to where it's illegal to be on your phone as you're driving. There are over 1.5 million car crashes a year caused from phones and over 385,000 injuries a year. So, the no phone rule is very a good addition and one of the best laws I've ever heard of.

On the other hand, some people argue that it shouldn't be a rule. They give pointless points like GPS, or ""Important Phone Calls"". There are easy fixes to these. If you are worried about getting an important call, connect your phone to your Bluetooth on your car. If your car doesn't have Bluetooth, whenever someone calls, you could just put it on speaker. For the GPS part, all you have to do it get a device that'll hold your phone for you. It allows you to see any calls, messages, or the GPS. There are many fixes for why not to have this law, but no good reason on why it shouldn't be a law.

In conclusion, drivers should not be allowed to hold their phone personally in their hand while driving. If that means zero access in some places, then so be it. It's not worth someone losing their life because you wanted to text someone back or talk to your significant other. But, if have a device that holds it for you is allowed, that they be a win-win for everyone. There's a right time for your phone, the car is not one.",1,1015d7b7692c43e689153ce6f59a984b
"The Electoral College is the cause of many political disagreements and problems whenever mentioned. Although established in the constitution, it is seen as undemocratic by many. The Electoral College takes away the ability of citizens to vote for their president instead they are voting for Electors, not always loyal to the candidate. As a result, I believe the Electoral College should only be used in instances of a tie between two candidates.

Each presidential candidate has a group of Electors, which will be part of the Electoral College process after the popular vote is taken. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting in which the vote for both President and Vice President occurs, and then the votes are counted by Congress. Office of the Federal Registera When the popular vote occurs, and the candidates are selected, the votes are tallied, and then the electors of the two candidates attend the meeting, and then the final decision for President is made. This is viewed as undemocratic, because there have been instances where the Electoral College disagrees with the popular vote. Such as the case of Al Gore in 2000, who won the popular vote, and then lost the Electoral vote and therefore his presidency.Bradford Plumera This caused over 60 percent of voters, to wish for a direct election opposed to the electoral process, according to a gallop poll, also occurring in 2000. Bradford Plumera Anotherr issue within the electoral college, is the electors themselves. While they may claim to be loyal to their candidate, loyalties can be bribed, changed, or electors may even be replaced with only a certain party Republican or Democratic. Which occured in Louisiana in 1960. The segregationists almost replaced Democratic electors, with ones who would instead oppose Kennedy, as a sabotage attempt at Kennedy's Presidency.Bradford Plumera There have also been cases in which the loyalty of the elector was switched, and the citizens were seemingly forgotten at the electoral college. While there are over millions of people residing in the United States, there are only 538 Electors, and the fate of our country is put in Electors who can't be trusted.

Over 60 percent of Americans oppose the Electoral college, but there are still some which still believe in the compromise established by our founding fathers. The Electoral College provides a smaller chance of election ties, and an equal vote from each state. While a tie is possible in the popular voting system, it is also possible in the Electoral College, with 538 electors, 269 votes from each side can cause a huge dissagreement within our Legislative System, which could be avoided by using only the popular vote. When politicians and presidential candidates are looking for votes, they most commonly travel to the larger states, because of the larger population. A larger population provides an even larger chance of obtaining voters. But, this leaves the small states with no attention from candidates, and a smaller population weakens the states chance of the candidate they desire. Every vote counts for a candidate,5,559 voters from Ohio, and 3,687 from Hawaii stopped a tie by voting. Bradford Plumera Even the small states contribute in a presidential elections, their votes are just as big as ours, even if their states ae small.

The founding fathers formed the Electoral College as a compromise, and hundreds of years later, I believe it is time for a compromise once again. The popular vote, should become the deciding vote for who is elected as President, Vice President, etc. With this, the chance of a tie comes, so i propose that the Electoral College remain only for the purpose of a tie in the popular vote, or if state legislature has reason to believe this candidate is not the best for America.

"Have you ever asked for advice? If you answered yes, did you ask more than one person? Well I'll tell why it's important to ask more than one person for advice. There are many advantages for asking more people they can have a different point of view, and you can trust the act more because there can be more people saying the same thing.

Asking multiple people for advice will give you different opinions and options. Different point of views allows you to have a second opinion. This could be asking both your mom and your dad, and they could help you pick out your shoes if you can't decide between the ""Kyrie 6 Pre-Heat New York City"" and the ""KD 12 All-Star Don-C"". Asking more than one person gives you different paths to take and gives more opportunities. Different people have different tastes from vacation spots to what sports they like to play. An addition to that, there personalities come in play as well. If they are given a task they could have different ways on completing it.

The next reason is trusting the opinion more. If there are more people that have the same idea you will trust it more. If you ask more people the more options you will get, and some of them could overlap and be connected. Majority is a big part in making a choice it can pressure you in a good way and a bad way. For example if you do not have enough money to buy somethings yo can be pressured to steel it. Instead an alternative option is to talk to your mom or a trusted adult about it before steeling. I think you should talk about it and ask before you act because it can clear up some misconceptions and help you make a better choice.

To finish it up these are some big ways that seeking multiple opinions can help. You can get more opinions on your idea and make a better choice. This is why getting multiple opinions is benifitical.",1,23a2f162d36c46aba0e1e7e1655498ed
"
Life can be challenging and the attitude we take towards it directly affects our experiences. Having a good attitude can make all the difference in a situation. It can help us to handle difficult circumstances with grace and show that life is not all doom and gloom.

A positive attitude can help us to look at the bright side of any circumstance and focus on what we have instead of what we don't have. It's easier to be optimistic when something is bad, rather than getting bogged down in negativity. It can help us to keep going in tough times and to remain resilient.

Having a good attitude allows us to enjoy life more and to make the most out of any situation. It encourages us to explore new opportunities and take risks. Furthermore, it can help us to build stronger relationships with ourselves as well as with others. When we have a positive outlook, it is easier to forgive and it can help reduce stress.

Ultimately, attitude serves as a resource for resilience in both life’s good times and its difficult moments. It is a tool that we can draw on to bring out our best. A good attitude can support us in achieving our goals, no matter how insurmountable they may seem. It is essential to have a positive outlook and approach life with a good attitude.",0,1fc2a65591184139b819ade047617e63
"In today's world, almost everyone has a smartphone. People should not use their phones while driving because phones are known for being a distraction. It can also be very dangerous. It is also illegal. The most dangerous place to use your phone is in the car.

Using your phone while driving is one of the leading cause of death in America. Phones are supposed to help make communication easier, but instead they cause a distraction. It can cause accidents people can get hurt and or can die. They can get tickets that can cost up to five-hundred dollars. Sometimes people get so distracted that they can crash into the rear end of another car and have to pay for the damages and or the other person's hospital bill.

Driving is a dangerous thing for everyone in the vehicle. The driver needs to stay focused for everyone's safety. It is impossible to multitask while driving a four-thousand pound vehicle. The driver does one bad movement and everything can go wrong in a matter of seconds. Many car companies have acknowledged this and have created a hands-free technology. Also Apple has a block on the phone while driving.

In many states, it is illegal to use your phone while driving because it can cause an accident. When the phone vibrates the driver normally looks down at the phone to see why it made the ringing sound, but in the minutes, that it takes the driver to reply to the texts something can go wrong. The moment they look at the phone, they are putting everyone in danger including themselves. Sometimes people do not realize that there is someone in front them until it's too late and ends up killing someone or crashing into an object. To prevent that it is extremely important to keep their eyes on the road at all times.

In conclusion, people should not use their phones while driving. They would feel a lot safer if the phone use would stop. Matter a fact apple blocks the phone from opening while driving.",1,c8038f5e23a24ecc87342570a7a750b5
"Was there a man on Mars? Magazines say yes, but the scientists have continuously said no. On May 24, 2001, NASA's ship, Viking 1, found something on Mars that had the facial features of a human. Scientists have proven that the piece of rock thought to resemble a human face is no more than just a natural landform through unusual shadows, facts that have been talked about with many scientists, and images taken that agreed with the facts.

First of all, NASA stated that they thought this landform was just another mesa found on Mars. The difference was that this strange, possible mesa obtained humanly facial features. Later, the fact the that the ""facial features"" on the mesa were due solely to unusual shadows, which gave the untrue image look like eyes, nose, and a mouth.

Next, the fact that the mesa is only a natural landform, not a face has been confirmed with countless scientists. On April 5, 1998, everyone was waiting to see what decision would be released about the mesa. Was it once a face of a person or just another landform on Mars? It appeared on the JPL website that there was no alien monument; it was just a nautral landform. Scientists have confirmed this. The only reason that it is even questioned is because people wanted to have been able to say that there was a face on Mars, even if it was proven otherwise. There is much more publicity for authors especially to say that there was a face on Mars. Unfortunately, scientists know the most in this situation, not authors.

Lastly, scientists took pictures to prove their evidence. In September 1997, Global Surveyor took a photograph of the landform that was ten times better quality than the original Viking picture of the ""face"". People who are not scientists still disagreed, so NASA and other scientists continued to take images. By the time it was 2001, the mesa did not look like a face anymore. The picture shows that it is clearly just a mesa.

In conclusion, people would be crazy to try to attempt to disagree with the scientists because of how many facts they have to prove their hypotheses. First, they explained why the mesa only looked like a face because of the illusinating shadows. Then, they confirmed it with other scientists. And lastly, the scientists took many photographs of the mesa that finally proved their point. Scientists proved their point by explaining unusual shadows, confirming information with additional scientists, and taking countless photographs of the mesa.",1,c4da420a91ae4d61ab01c094912b5b10
"In today's digital age, the prevalence of online shopping has become increasingly popular. For those who are unfamiliar with this phenomenon, online shopping is the process of buying goods or services over the internet without having to leave one’s home or workplace. Although there are many advantages to shopping online, there are also a few drawbacks that must be considered as well. One major advantage of online shopping is convenience and ease-of-use. Shopping from an online store allows customers to quickly find what they need and place their order in a matter of minutes. Furthermore, since most stores offer free shipping for orders above a certain amount, customers don't have to worry about spending extra money on transportation costs associated with traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Another benefit is selection and price; since more products can fit into an average website than into physical retail locations, shoppers tend to have access to more options when it comes time for them make purchase decisions. Additionally, prices tend to be lower due to competition between retailers on different platforms as well as discounts through coupons and promotional codes available exclusively for virtual shops. On the other hand, there are some disadvantages associated with online shopping that should not be overlooked either. One issue is that customers cannot physically examine items before purchasing them which may lead buyers regretting their purchases if they later discover flaws or defects in the product once it arrives at their doorstep. Also, security concerns related identity theft and fraud can give people pause when considering whether or not they should trust an unknown website enough enter sensitive financial information such as credit card numbers during checkout processes which could potentially put customer's data at risk by leaving it vulnerable hackers looking steal personal data like names addressess Social Security Number etc .

"When it comes to learning English, many people believe that both reading and speaking are equally important skills. However, I believe that speaking is more important for Chinese learners.

One reason why speaking is more important for Chinese learners is that Chinese is a tonal language. This means that the meaning of words can change depending on the tone that is used. For example, the word “cat” can have different meanings in a high-pitched tone and a low-pitched tone. Chinese learners who are not used to tonal language will have a harder time understanding English if they only focus on reading.

Another reason why speaking is more important for Chinese learners is that Chinese is a complex language. Chinese has a large number of characters, and each character has a specific meaning. Chinese learners who only focus on reading will have a hard time understanding the meaning of words. By speaking, Chinese learners can gain a better understanding of the language and be able to communicate more effectively.

In conclusion, I believe that speaking is more important for Chinese learners when it comes to learning English. This is because Chinese is a complex language, and Chinese learners who only focus on reading will have a hard time understanding the meaning of words.

"When asking for advice it is better to ask multiple people rather than one person. Asking more than person can help you because not all people have the same mind set. Sometimes if you only ask one person for advice they can give you something they think is right in that situation but it can turn out not the right advice that you needed. But if you ask multiple people like three or four and see what the common opinion is you can take the right advice. And people tend to ask more than one people because they dont want to be provided the wrong advice. And if you are provided the wrong advice you cloud lose trust.

It is better to ask more than one person for many reasons for example if you ask one of your friends if what you should wear to a party and they give you what they they think. And then you go and see every body there is wearing a different style than yours. But that could have been avoided if you had asked the advice of four friends and then they could have given you the style that they thought was worn. Another example is if you ask one of your friends what you should get as a snack and they give you a bag of chips and later on you dont like the chips. But if you would have asked multiple friends what a good snack was they would have probably recommended a better snack than the chips. Or if you ask if you think you should ask somebody out and they say yeah or if you ask some more friends and they dont think its that great in idea to ask that person out.

The advice from a group would most likely be better than by asking one of your friends. Because if you ask one person whats in style. Than can give you some advice and then you take their advice and you wear it and people dont like it. Or if you need advice on what you should do in a situation and you ask one of your close friends what they thin you should do and they give you the wrong advice you cloud wind up doing the wrong thing in that situation. And sometimes they can lead you into the wrong things would get you in trouble. Or you cloud be put in a situation that you dont know what is right and you take the wrong advice could have a bad reputation or it could lead to you losing people you were close to. And you cloud hurt somebody if you do take the wrong advice which could lead to getting shamed.

And that is why asking more than one person is better than asking one person and that person only. because no matter who you ask youre probably going to get multiple answers but you can compare and see who has common advice. you want to ask the group so you dont get embarrassed in front of people or eat something that you dont like that isnt very popular among people. Or something you dont enjoy doing that person thinks is fun but it is a popular opinion to people. But if you ask a hand full of close friends or even just people you can see the common advice people will give of what they think they would do in your situation and you can see that more people think something else is right rather than the one or two people who thin something else is right.",1,6a4eed3d489a4c948719f1b6cb649dc9

"With the face on mars no one belived that it was actually a face they thought that it was and ancient monument on mars and when NASA first saw the face on mars they thought that it was the landging place of the viking 1's sister ship the viking 2. Then when they put that photo out of the face on mars people were using it in haunted grocery stores checkout lines, radio talk shows, magazines, books, and hollywood films.

Then even some scientists belived that they face was an alien artifact so when people did not belive them they went and took more picture of the face but it was mars cloudy day and people still did not belive them. So NASA went back for another one but to get a better picture they had to get closer to the face and role the ship twenty five degrees to the center they also had to go over the face very often because it was hard to get the picture.

The spaceship would look over mars like a faxing machine but lucky for them going around the face very often it got to a point to were their was no clouds and they were able to get a good shot of the face. So NASA was able to get a better picture of the face so that people would belive them that it was a face in the surface on mars.

"Phones and Driving

Phones play a big role in the generation we now live in. We may not realize how phones or electronics in general are affecting society and what we do on a daily basis. These phones are affecting human life slowly from all ages including babies. One of the main impact that cell phones have had on society is the use of them while driving a vehicle and this shouldn't be allowed.

In many cases using a cell phone while driving has had a big impact on society and should be banned in all States. People should not be allowed to use their phones while driving For instance people texting or talking on the phone (physically holding phone)while driving is a big distraction. These people are the causes of accidents and usually innocent people die because of dull decisions people take.

As a result the CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has stated that in 2016, 3,450 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver and the numbers have increased over the years. Also according to them when people take their eyes off for five seconds while going fifty-five mile per hour, it is long enough to cover a football field (""Distracted Driving"") . There are billions of reasons why people go against it and why we should have them banned while driving and this is for our safety.

Everyone on the road is at risk. We can all help out by taking action to prevent innocent people's life. For example by simply just putting away the cell phone, you can prevent so many things and reduce the chances of crashing and you'll be more focused on the road. We can also text or call anyone before starting the car and then put on Do Not Disturb that iphones provide, which does not allow calls or texts from anyone. There are so many options to prevent you touching your phone while driving. We just all have to take action and make the road a safer place .

"Dear Senator,

The topic of the Electoral college is a hot one, and the idea of whether of not to adjust it is contravercial. Many citizen disagree with the process while many are in favor. What should we do? We should change the Electoral College. The voting is based more on quantity instead of quality, and the voting is not coming from the citizen's directly, making the risk of an unfaithful candidate too high and the actual voting less popular and more electoral. When one state-or even one person- could change the whole ball game that is the Presidential Election, then what does that mean for our democracy?

While many will argue that it is a fair way to vote, the Electoral College has many flaws. First off, the candidates are focusing on more power and higher tallying states to get them through the election than everyone as a whole. For example, if you were a presidential candidate would you spend more time trying to sway California, with its whopping 55 electoral votes, or Montanna, with a teeny tiny 3 electoral votes? The candidates are not being considerate of ALL the American citizens, but instead the ones that they think will lead them to victory. This is not what the election is all about. The election is more focused on the popular vote of few states with many inhabitants than it is on many states with few citizens.

""Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" (As stated in

""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong""

). Being that this true, why do we call it the ""Presidential Election"" instead of the ""Electors Election?"" Electors claim to be faithful to their candidates but sometimes this is not the case. If a member of the group is unfaithful to their candidate, it could unsettle the whole election, meaning that the United States as a whole would have to pay for the electors actions. This is not how voting was meant to be. Our slogan is ""We the People,"" not ""We the Electors.""

Now, I know what you're thinking, ""Why would we change this system? It is already established and has worked for many years."" In order to move forward as a nation we as a whole need to make changes sometimes. Just think what it would be like today if segregation-an established rule and law- was not questioned. Or even if the settlers of the United States had not questioned our former mother country and broke away. We would not even be the establishment we are today if we did not question established rules or traditions. The Electoral College is nothing more than a system that needs to be reevaluated, putting the popularity if the candidate in clearer perspective.

To recap, The Electoral College does not include the popularity of the candidates over official influences. The states are not being counted equally and electors control the electon overall. In order to have a more successful government and a more included population, the Electoral College simply needs to be reevaluated and changed to meet the popularity standards of our country if we are to ever advance.",1,2997d07ad0d84ea1bd13c6bc9163a73b
"I am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. I think this because if a student is having a hard time in class and is stressed out, or even getting mad the teacher can help them.

The first quote that supports my claim is ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of mona lisa."" This quote supports my claim because it tells what the facial action coding system can do.

The second quote that supports my claim is ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" This quote supports my claim because this quote is saying how some people might not be able to tell what someones emotions are so the facial action coding system could help them do that.

The last quote that supports my claim is when Dr. Huang predicts ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This quote supports my claim because Dr. Huang says that it could help recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.

If a student is having a hard time in class and is stressed out or even getting mad the teacher can help them. I believe this to still be true and maybe one day the facial action coding system will help us in the class room or anywhere all over the world.",1,76e634d3dad24dcbbeb70ba40709af7f
"Mr. Senator election by popular votee is the way to go, let the people decide! It's their choice to pick who runs the U.S.A. this is the choice of who they want to run the country. The citizens should have a right to votee for who they really want. Instead of having a couple hundred people I think we should have all the people in the country choose. So why dont we? We can establish this rule and make it right let the citizens of the U.S.A. pick who the president should be!

Electoral collage as the office of Federal Register in quote ""The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting og the electors where they votee for the President and Vice President"". It's a bad idea to me when you can just make everyone votee for who they want not who just a couple hundred people want. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors which a certain amount need to votee as 270 is the precise number is required. Each candidate running each has a group of electors, they are originally chosen by the candidates politicial party. The choice where the people choose and votee is way easier than that, we have a choice for what we want.

The ""Indefensible Electoral College"" is wrong your voteing for the electors as it says in paragraph 10. Bradford Plumer says as I quote ""Under the electoral college system voteers votee not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President. There for we are voteing for the electors right? So whats the whole point when we can stick to our ways and vote ourselves. This makes it way more simple and faster, better than waiting through the system for other people to votee, when you can just do it yourself.

Theres no reason for each party to select a slate of electors. It can be argued that this system can turn off potential voteers as a candidate. There are 5 reasons for retaining this system. Those are certainty of outcome, everyone's President, swing States, Big states, and avoid runoff elections. Still we need to be able to make our own decisions. We don't need other people to make them for us.

These people in the U.S.A. are determined in what they want, not what other people want. They want to choose what they believe they don't want to go through a long system. When you can just do it yourself its easier, because you know what your doing but if you go the other way you have to teach the people your working with. When you have the whole Country voteing it makes it more simple and easy to go through the process. So let the people choose who they really want as the President of the U.S.A. dont leave it to other people to do it for them.",1,217cd3f5884d45c199d666da3059f630
